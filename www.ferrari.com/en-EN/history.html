These events live on inside you as memories. This is the case for Ferrari and its first victory which came in 1947 courtesy of the 125 S. That win would be the first milestone in the genuinely unparalleled sporting career of a team that has clocked up more Formula 1 victories than any other. That first win had its roots in mid-1945 when Enzo Ferrari commissioned Gioachino Colombo to design a completely innovative car for him. Ferrari’s ambition was, of course, to beat the Alfa Romeos which he knew intimately as he had spent so much time with the Milan team, first as a driver, then as sporting director, racking up triumph after triumph in the pre-War years. As far as Enzo Ferrari was concerned the engine was the heart of any car. Hence his incredible focus on the power unit from that first design onwards. The choice fell on a 12-cylinder architecture, which would have the power to deliver the kind of performance required. The engine moniker, 125, referenced its unit displacement: 125 multiplied by 12 gives the overall displacement of the engine, a mere 1,500cc."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"400eb31a-abc4-4cf3-b122-7d9ba0c38277"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"The months flew by as work ploughed ahead on building the engine with Gioachino Colombo handing over the design reins to Giuseppe Busso. Luigi Bazzi assisted in the fine tuning and the unit’s power output burgeoned on the test-bench, eventually rising to just under 120 bhp at 6,800 rpm. In the meantime, Gilco of Milan, a company that specialised in high-strength steel tubing for the aeronautical industry, was busy making the tubular chassis.","image":{"landscapeBig":"5d03ae39107b060e8f5279e1"}},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"It was stiff but light, just as Ferrari had requested, with two longitudinal side members and a central X-shaped cross-member in oval-section tubes. On March 12 1947, an engine roared across the countryside between Maranello and nearby Formigine. The as-yet-unbodied 125 had sprung to life and the great Ferrari adventure had begun. Two months later, on May 11 1947, the 125 S made its racing debut at the Piacenza Circuit. The S in its name stood for Sport, referring to its open sports car body style. At its wheel was Franco Cortese. Two cars were actually entered in the race – the second was a 125 C which, although identical in terms of its running gear had a narrow single-seater body (hence the C for ‘competition’). Nino Farina was selected to drive it. Unfortunately, the Turin-born driver was unhappy with the car he’d been allotted and demanded his team-mate’s vehicle.

He completed 40 laps of the Terme di Caracalla circuit laid out on the tree-lined boulevards around the ancient Roman baths, for a total of 137.6 kilometres, at an average speed of 88.5 km/h.

It was the first of its kind and Enzo Ferrari was well aware of that fact.   \nThe versatile sports prototypes had proved themselves capable of winning on circuits of all kinds – permanent, city, dirt track. They were now, however, ready to step into the limelight at other prestige international events. Concours d’Elegance, for instance, were starting to gain popularity, becoming an important avenue both for meeting new clients and selling cars customised to suit each owners’ tastes and requirements. Many of the customers were privateer drivers who bought the 166 MM in its racing set-up to field in various competitions. Others, however, were simply well-heeled drivers who opted for the road-going version, often happily also specifying various modifications to the exterior and the cabin. Ferrari wanted to apply the same approach to other international motor shows, and was eager to launch the car at what was one of the world’s most important events - Turin was also home to various car marques and coachworks. For the 166 MM Touring Superleggera’s body, Ferrari turned to the Milanese coachworks that had invented the eponymous Superleggera construction system, which had already proved its worth in the aeronautics industry. The patented method involved fixing aluminum alloy panels directly to a small-diameter steel tubular spaceframe. As a result, the chassis and bodywork formed a single, homogenous unit, providing good structural rigidity and anticipating the weight-bearing chassis concept that would be introduced years later. The 166 MM’s clean, simple forms also proved exceptionally aerodynamically efficient. It had a very low dry weight of just 650 kg too, but its V12 engine unleashed 140 bhp and its fuel tank held 90-litres. \nJust 25 Touring Superleggera-bodied 166 MMs were built.

This result, and those achieved in the other races by the crews with the new 4,500 cc 375 MM helped Ferrari win the first World Sportscar Championship in 1953. The story of Matzotto and Ferrari started in 1948, when the driver met Enzo Ferrari at the factory to buy a 166 Inter Touring 2-litre. At that time a car could be customised from scratch, so Marzotto went to Maranello to do precisely that. The Marzotto family were excellent Ferrari customers, and Gianni, when racing with the Lancia Aprilia, demonstrated his speed. There he developed a frank relationship marked by mutual respect, although with no shortage of disagreements. To understand what sort of driver Marzotto was, suffice it to say that he used to change gears without the clutch, by ear, listening to the rising rev count. In October 1949 Ferrari tested him in the Vermicino-Rocca di Papa time trial, which Marzotto won. The following year, four members of the Marzotto family started the Mille Miglia with four Ferraris paid in cash – two 195 S models entered by Scuderia Ferrari for Giannino and his brother Vittorio, and two 166 MMs of Scuderia Marzotto for Paolo and Umberto."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"530d209e-bf4a-4a91-913b-8ec45ae79f32"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"The fans’ eyes were on the official cars of the more famous Alberto Ascari and Luigi Villoresi, but at the end of a rain-soaked edition with 375 starters, Giannino Marzotto and Marco Crosara won in the 195 S Berlinetta Touring.

Included in the haul were six examples of the D50 single-seater. The D50 had proved extremely promising, but Lancia had never managed to fully exploit its potential. However, once in the hands of the Scuderia Ferrari, the car began to deliver on its promise. At the first Grand Prix of the season in Buenos Aires, the Prancing Horse team fielded four D50s entrusted to Fangio, Luigi Musso, Eugenio Castellotti and Olivier Gendebien, while young Peter Collins was still in the 4-cylinder 555.

As foreseen, Collins was forced to retire while von Trips escorted Taruffi to the finish line, telling the press that he had tried to attack him in the previous stretches but had failed. The German was only 29 years old and, out of respect, had no problem in accepting team orders that always favoured the veterans.

As always, the endurance season started in America, with two Florida classics, in Daytona and Sebring. The latter, with the traditional 12-hour race, was the first round of the World Sportscar Championship. The Sebring circuit is totally unique. It occupies a part of Hendricks Field airport, which during the Second World War was a training centre for B-17 ‘Flying Fortress’ bomber pilots. The main feature of the track is still the same today – stretches of concrete, which put the cars under considerable stress. This is why people often say that, in terms of wear, the 12 Hours of Sebring is equivalent to the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In fact, many teams have used the American race to develop prototypes for the Circuit de la Sarthe classic. In late 1959 Sebring also hosted the first edition of the United States Grand Prix, in which Tony Brooks finished third, and, unfortunately lost the World Championship by a few points, the Scuderia having missed the British Grand Prix due to a strike."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"02ba806d-3048-4223-9c9b-10b9a117625f"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Ferrari was favourite in the 12 Hours of Sebring with four official cars on the track – three 250 Testa Rossa models and, for the first time, a 250 GT California Spider, joined by several other specimens entered by private teams and NART of Luigi Chinetti.

It seemed the deal was done but it fell through due to a misunderstanding. Ferrari and Moss tried again 10 years later, at the end of 1961, when an agreement was reached to supply the Rob Walker team with a Formula 1 car and the British Racing Partnership (BRP) – the team of Alfred Moss, Stirling’s father – with a 250 GTO. When everything was ready, Moss was out of action, the victim of a terrible accident in a Lotus at Goodwood, which put an end to his career. That marriage could have changed the history of F1 and have delivered Moss the world title he never won, having only ever taken four second places. Nevertheless, Moss raced 15 times with Prancing Horse cars, winning 12; following the two victories in the Tourist Trophy with the 250 GT Berlinetta of Rob Walker in 1960 and 1961, everything was set for the agreement that unfortunately bore no fruit. The first time Moss raced a Ferrari was in 1957, in the Bahamas, when the Briton won two races in the Nassau Trophy at the wheel of a 290 MM belonging to the Temple Buell team. Then he triumphed in Cuba in 1958 with a 335 S entered by Luigi Chinetti.

At the start of the Tourist Trophy in 1962 he was replaced by Innes Ireland, who triumphed! It was a memorable edition, with an all-Ferrari podium: behind the 250 GTO of Ireland came the cars driven by Graham Hill and Mike Parkes who, in that order, went on to dominate the 1963 edition.Hill won again the following year this time at the wheel of the 330 P, ahead of David Piper, who was competing for his own team in a Ferrari 250 LM.

Before this, however, Ferrari went through something of an inner struggle. Enzo had to change his mind and agree to put ‘the cart before the horse’ by launching a single-seater and sports car with the engine behind the driver. The decision paid off extraordinarily, with three world titles in one go: Drivers’ and Constructors’ in F1, plus the World Sportscar Championship. Of course, not everything went right as with the tragic death of Ferrari driver Wolfgang von Trips. In addition, that triumphant season ended in a storm, with the team acquiring a totally new management and technical leadership. The 156 F1 designed by Carlo Chiti astonished everyone because it was the first Ferrari mid-engine single-seater. It was dubbed ‘the shark’, due to its innovatively shaped nose with two angled vents that made it look like the great predator. This car helped Phil Hill to win the Drivers’ title by one point over the unfortunate Von Trips, who lost his life in Monza, together with 15 fans. The other Ferrari driver, Richie Ginther, was fifth in the final rankings. Phil Hill set a new Nürburgring record in qualifying, lapping in less than nine minutes, and was also the first American driver to win the F1 World Championship."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"48935775-d6a4-4f34-9795-2b762ba36388"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"The young Giancarlo Baghetti also had a day of glory in the 156, winning on his F1 debut at Reims, with a Scuderia Sant’Ambroeus vehicle hired from the Italian federation.

Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien came first. The Belgian driver – this time paired with Von Trips – repeated the feat soon after at the Targa Florio, behind the wheel of the 246 SP. While the Nürburgring 1000 Kilometres just yielded placings (from 2nd to 5th), the 24 Hours of Le Mans brought another great hat-trick, Hill and Gendebien won again. However, the Italians Lorenzo Bandini and Giorgio Scarlatti won the last World Championship race, the Pescara Grand Prix.

The 250 GTO delivered three world championships to Maranello from 1962 to 1964, plus many victories in the most prestigious races.

Le Mans was a Maranello fiefdom from 1960, with the three consecutive wins by the specialist Olivier Gendebien: one paired with Paul Frère in an all-Belgian crew, and two with Phil Hill, but actually the duo had previously won in 1958. So 1964 was the fourth consecutive victory for the Prancing Horse; another couple came over the following years. The P 250 was a car from which much was expected, since it was the first with a 3-litre 310 hp mid-engined 12-cylinder power unit. It was designed by Pininfarina, now written as one word, after a decree in 1961 by President of Italy Giovanni Gronchi allowing the change of surname. The car stood out for the rollbar/wing behind the driver’s head and the two air intakes on the rear wheel arches, accompanying a very clean and effective line. In 1963 it won three races out of four and took the World Endurance title.\n\n"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d05580110a7220b561f9297","portraitMedium":"5d0557c312e3b50c1510abf8"}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"1963 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["250-p","330-p","250-lm","156-f1-63"]},"slug":"le-mans-italy","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-15T20:43:38.129Z","id":"5d0558763ad9250aee5324ac","original":"5d0558763ad9250aee5324ac","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-15T20:43:34.382Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:19:53.708Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"HERO OF THE TWO WORLDS: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"1964 - HERO OF THE TWO WORLDS","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots","content":"index-follow"},{"name":"description","content":"The year 1964 was historic for the racing world: “Big John” succeeded in his quest to become the Formula 1 World Champion.

Then along came racing, a passion that had devoured him since boyhood, never flourishing fully due to his choice of career. A shame, as he clearly has the potential to establish himself as a champion, and triumph in a lot more than the 19 international races that he actually won. Enzo Ferrari considered him an ideal driver for the sports-protoypes, and was proved right – with Jean Guichet, Vaccarella won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1964 behind the wheel of the 275 P, helping the Maranello Scuderia to win the World Sports Car Championship. Such was his dedication to his school, however, that Vaccarella skipped the celebrations following his victory at Le Mans, choosing instead to go to work on the Monday morning after the race. In the magical year of 1964, Vaccarella also came second at Sebring (as he did in ’63), and took first place in the 1000 km of the Nürburgring and in the Coppa Intereuropa at Monza. Then in 1965, he sped to victory with a Ferrari on home turf in the Targa Florio, 72 km over difficult and gruelling roads through the Madonie mountains. In this edition of the race, he drove alongside Lorenzo Bandini, taking an all-Italian victory ahead of a host of Porsche and Ford works cars present. They set a new record for the circuit, completing the ten laps (a distance of 720 km in total) in 7 hours 1 minute and 12 seconds, in front of around 250,000 spectators"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"8489101a-852e-4fcf-9e34-190c1ad2e8ad"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Vaccarella was 32, while Bandini was just 30. Together, they represented the youth of Italy, driving fast and making their mark in the international arena. It became apparent that Ferrari had a soft spot for young Italians, treating them like sons, taking them on in dribs and drabs so as not to place them in direct competition with one another. The team tried to launch their careers without burning them out or losing them, so they gave them each a turn, one by one. In 1965, Ferrari earmarked the F1 Italian Grand Prix for Vaccarella, where he raced in a 158 F1, remaining in sixth place until he was forced to withdraw due to engine failure. Regardless of this, 1964 and 1965 were enchanted years for the Sicilian driver. His companion Bandini, fresh from taking 4th place in the F1 World Championship, also won at Le Mans, as well as twice taking second place in the Targa Florio. From this result, it seems that his heart was truly set on winning the Sicilian marathon. With Vaccarella, he finally succeeded.\nTheir car for the Targa Florio was one the models from the all-conquering P series, developed over four years from 1964 onwards; the 275 P2 was the first evolution of this range and came out in 1965 alongside the 330 P2, which featured a larger engine."},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d05fae93ad9250aee5324b7","portraitMedium":"5d05faff107b060e8f527a60"}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"1965 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["330-p2","275-p2","dino-166p","dino-206-sp"]},"slug":"victory-at-targa","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-16T08:19:13.412Z","id":"5d05fb7c12e3b50c1510ac04","original":"5d05fb7c12e3b50c1510ac04","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-16T08:19:08.966Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:20:04.274Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"365 P JEWEL: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"1966 - 365 P JEWEL","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots","content":"index-follow"},{"name":"description","content":"Ferrari 365 P Berlinetta Speciale: the car was presented at the 1966 Paris Motor Show, in White Gardenia.

It was so beautiful that Gianni Agnelli fell in love with it and commissioned a second copy, which was delivered the following year in Turin, in metallic grey and with a rear spoiler. At first glance it’s the shape that attracts, with its slender long, clean lines, with sloping struts on the tail. Although it was a longer car, it was a precursor for the lines seen on future Dino models. Exterior details included a glass sunroof that was cutting edge for the time, a visible petrol cap, air vents in front of the rear wheel arches, and a dual exhaust. However, the most notable feature was concealed in the passenger compartment: this car was a three-seater, with the driver’s seat in the centre. This unique feature was rare for its time, but was then picked up by a couple of other manufacturers a few years later. That’s not all though. For the first time, a Ferrari GT used a mid-engine architecture, in this case using the race-derived 4.4-litre V12. In fact, the mechanics were taken largely from the racing Ferrari 365 P2. US importer, Luigi Chinetti, bought the white model, selling it and buying it back twice. It was auctioned in 2014 with 7900 km on the clock, but an offer of nearly USD 23 million was rejected! Gianni Agnelli kept his version for a few years, before selling it in the US. One of the two cars was repainted, first in metallic blue and then red, but the original colours of the two specimens are white and metallic grey. Gianni Agnelli said of the car: “You didn’t have time to stop before people were immediately around it. But it was fun. It had monstrous acceleration. You just had to get used to the driver’s seat in the middle, because it gave an ideal any reference points to either side, right or left.”"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d05ffe810a7220b561f929c","portraitMedium":"5d05ffe810a7220b561f929c"}},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"1966 Masterpieces","portraitMedium":""}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"1966 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["dino-206-s","330-p3","365-california","330-gts"]},"slug":"365-p-jewel","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-16T08:40:04.963Z","id":"5d060060107b060e8f527a62","original":"5d060060107b060e8f527a62","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-16T08:40:00.494Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:20:07.185Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"LEGENDARY FINISH: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"1967 - LEGENDARY FINISH","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots","content":"index-follow"},{"name":"description","content":"1967: Three Ferraris – two 330 P4s and a 412 P – take the first three places in the 24 Hours of Daytona.

However, in 1966, it was the turn of the more powerful Fords. The two headed to Daytona in early 1967 for the first round of the International Constructors’ Championship (as the World Sport Championship was renamed for two years), with two separate classifications for GTs and prototypes. In order to close the gap on Ford, Ferrari spent the winter of 1966 working hard in Maranello. The new 330 P4 was designed by Mauro Forghieri, with a number of P3 models being updated too, becoming 330 P3/ P4s. The abbreviation 412 P identified the customer version of the latter vehicle. Intended for use by private teams, it lacked a number of strategic components such as the injection system, which was replaced by normal carburettors. The 330 P4 boasted sophisticated aerodynamics, developed in the wind tunnels at Pininfarina and at the Polytechnic in Stuttgart, Germany, the city where both Mercedes and Porsche are based. The P4 had a lower Cd than its predecessors, with greater downforce and a very low nose section. The 4-litre, 450 hp V12 engine featured double overhead camshafts and 3 valves per cylinder. The gearbox, made by Ferrari, was also new, along with the car’s suspension system. In addition, in order to prepare for the competition, and despite the high cost of the entire trip, Scuderia Ferrari decide to travel to Daytona in December 1966, for a test day on the track. The results were very promising. Enzo Ferrari nominated journalist Franco Lini as his sporting director – as well as being competent and agreeable, Lini was also an expert in international regulations. During the race, everything went well. Ferrari dominated, and then Lini has a stroke of genius: he asked the Ferrari drivers, who were in the first three places in the race, to stage a side-by-side parade finish along the banking. The finish was immortalised by the American press agencies, and made its way around the world, becoming one of the most famous photos ever in automotive history. The triumphant finish graced the front pages of every major newspaper in the world, and marked Ferrari’s revenge over its rivals. Curiously, Chris Amon was in the winning team both at Le Mans in 1966 with Ford and at Daytona in ’67 with Ferrari, but he never succeeded in taking home an F1 victory."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"4252c319-c379-46fa-9e65-49bbe99ce7c6"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"In summary, the end result saw the 330 P3/P4 (P3 chassis and P4 engine) spider driven by Bandini/Amon come first, followed by the 330 P4 coupé driven by Parkes-Scarfiotti and the 412 P from Luigi Chinetti’s NART team in third, driven by Rodriguez-Guichet.

Pininfarina had been aware of this for some time, and thanks to Leonardo Fioravanti’s skilful pencil, there were already drawings ready. The new car was wedge shaped and very slender, with great attention paid to aerodynamics, and a truncated tail. Sergio Pininfarina liked the design, and later altered the final shape of the car, streamlining the nose even further, which initially had a large Plexiglas strip that integrated the headlights. This feature would be eliminated in 1971, with the adoption of retractable headlights. Ferrari approved the project, and in 1967, began the construction of the first prototype. In 1968, the car was ready for the limelight. From a technical perspective, the engineering team in Maranello maintained the classic chassis construction with a tubular spaceframe with oval-section tubes. The front and rear track were wider to accommodate the additional performance available from the 320-hp 4.4-litre dual overhead camshaft V12. The 365 refers to the displacement per cylinder, the 4 to the camshafts, while B stands for berlinetta: this is the origin of the name 365 GTB4. At the time, the Paris Motor Show was considered to be the leading event of its kind, the most important of all, perhaps due to the charm of the City of Light, but the fact remains that all the exciting new models made their catwalk debut there. The Daytona could reach speeds of more than 280 km/h, with outstanding acceleration, and was relatively easy to drive, keeping in mind that it was still a GT. It was the most high-performance car of the period. Like any self-respecting Ferrari, it proved fast on the track too, and won its category at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1972, ’73, and ’74, and took second place at Daytona in 1979: an amazing testament to the longevity of the design, especially given that in the meantime production of the car had ceased. As usual, Luigi Chinetti requested a spider version for the American market, and for California in particular. The 365 GTS4 was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1969.\n\n"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d060fb212e3b50c1510ac0a","portraitMedium":""}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"1968 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["612-can-am","dino-246-tasmania","312-f1-68"]},"slug":"tribute-to-the-triumph","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-16T09:50:18.941Z","id":"5d0610c73ad9250aee5324bb","original":"5d0610c73ad9250aee5324bb","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-16T09:49:59.831Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:19:53.709Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"ARGENTINE TANGO: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"1968 - ARGENTINE TANGO","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots","content":"index-follow"},{"name":"description","content":"1968: De Adamich wins Temporada with Ferrari Dino 166 F2.

The Temporada was founded when the Automobile Club of Argentina (ACC) invited European drivers to compete in a championship, held not only in Argentina but also Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. The ACA also bought cars for young local racing talent. The first of these “migrations” to the south took place at the end of the 1947 season, a time when Argentina was ruled by General Juan Domingo Peron – a racing enthusiast and generous funder. Scuderia Ferrari participated for the first time in 1948. Over the years, in line with the political toing and froing, the Temporada was suspended, only to be reborn thanks to Juan Manuel Fangio and, almost 20 years later in 1968, thanks to the national oil company. The Temporada was based on four races for Formula 2 cars, and Scuderia Ferrari competed with two Dino 166s, driven by Ernesto “Tino” Brambilla and Andrea De Adamich. The starting line-up included 25 top-level drivers, some whom had already raced in Formula 1, including Jochen Rindt, Clay Regazzoni, Jean-Pierre Beltoise, Jo Siffert, Silvio Moser, and Pedro Rodriguez, driving for teams including Techno, Matra, Brabham, and Lotus. The Dino 166 F2 had already appeared in 1967 and competed in just a single race, with Jonathan Williams in Rouen. It was developed thanks to an agreement with Fiat to produce 500 engines for the Dino road car which carried the Fiat and Ferrari marque.

He became CEO in 1963, and Chairman three years later. Agnelli was a great admirer of Ferrari cars, and indeed, became a customer of the brand. His first Ferrari was a 166 MM Touring Superleggera, from 1948; later his others included the 365 P and the Testarossa Spider. Over the years, Enzo Ferrari was aware that he could no longer bear the financial burden of the marque’s sporting activity alone, and in 1963, came close to selling to Ford. The tough negotiations lasted throughout April and May, but just before he signed, Enzo backed out, preserving the autonomy of the brand’s racing division. The desire to find a strong ally, however, remained paramount, and in 1965, Ferrari reached an agreement with Fiat to produce the 6-cylinder Dino engine, designed by Ferrari and developed at the factories of the Turin-based company, to be fitted on the new Fiat Dino, spider and coupé. Soon after came the Dino Ferrari, made in Maranello. Ferrari was required to receive type-approval for the Ferrari Dino 166 for F2, and to do this, the company built more than 500 production models, with the engine designed during this period by Enzo’s son. From then on, the conversations between Ferrari and Agnelli regarding a possible takeover became increasingly frequent.

With streamlined, low and extremely aggressive lines, it was the first production Ferrari to be fitted with the boxer-type 12-cylinder engine derived from the F1 unit. The technical approach taken was completely different from that adopted on all other Ferrari models produced so far, and the architecture was not that of the classic front-engined V12s – the longitudinally-mounted engine featured opposing cylinder banks. The two Bs stand for Berlinetta Boxer. This name was derived from the fact that the cylinder banks form an angle of 180°, producing an engine with a flat, rectangular shape which enabled the car’s centre of gravity to be lowered. From a technical standpoint, this solution rendered design and construction more complex. Precisely for this reason, the gestation period for this model took longer than usual.

The contrast gave the car a super sporty, modern look, pre-empting a trend that is still in vogue today. The satin black finish for the lower part of the car became an option on the entire range built in Maranello, and was referred to as the “Boxer” paint finish. The curved line which marked the boundary of the passenger compartment, behind the seats, created the optical illusion of a small door. A matte black spoiler was mounted at the end of the car’s roof.

That was largely due to the installation of the F1 derived 3,000 cc, 460 hp 12-cylinder Boxer. Therefore, 1971 was a year of development, with a promising one-two in the 9 hours of Kyalami that boded well for the coming year, with Clay Regazzoni and Brian Redman finished ahead of Mario Andretti and Jacky Ickx. In the 1972, season Ferrari registered three cars with fast and highly experienced drivers. In addition to the four who competed in Kyalami, Ronnie Peterson, Tim Schenken and Arturo Merzario made regular appearances. Rally champions Sandro Munari, Helmut Marko and Carlos Pace also competed in some races. The programme’s sports director was former driver Peter Schetty, winner of the European Mountain Championship in 1969, who did not hesitate to change the make up of the crews in order to defeat the Alfa Romeos, Porsches and Matras. Indeed, Ferrari’s domination turned out to be overwhelming, with 10 wins out of 10 races. Two Ferraris were on the podium in every race: including eight one-twos, plus a victory and third place at Monza. The highlight came at Zeltweg, when the four Ferraris took the top four positions. Maranello won the 1972 Championship for Makes, with Andretti and Ickx leading the way with four wins, while the Belgian driver won another two with Regazzoni and Redman. The latter won twice, the second time with Merzario, who also finished first with Munari in the Targa Florio. The victory in Sicily was a stroke of genius. Ferrari had the great idea of deploying the rally champion out of his natural environment, and the driver – although not as fast as Merzario – showed his mettle with sports cars; both on the road in Sicily and in the 1000km of Zeltweg.

Moreover, it was styled by Bertone, not Pininfarina, for the first time since 1953.","excerpt":"","audioId":"ccd1b790-8a5f-4dde-b9de-1a11e2bd3a69","background":{"landscapeBig":"5d064bc010a7220b561f92a7","portraitMedium":"5d064bf412e3b50c1510ac17"},"backgroundMobile":{"landscapeMedium":"5d064bc010a7220b561f92a7","portraitMedium":"5d064bf412e3b50c1510ac17"},"blocks":[{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d064c0910a7220b561f92a8","portraitMedium":"5d064c0910a7220b561f92a8"}},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"But there was a reason for this. It was designed by Marcello Gandini who, working for the Turin body shop, created many of the most popular sports cars of the era, for several marques. His masterpieces were typically sharp and slender shaped, very futuristic and with strong personalities. Ferrari was impressed by this approach to sports car design, and decided to use the Dino logo to diversify. Bertone also designed the Fiat Dino coupé, while Pininfarina designed the Spider. The car was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show and just carried the Dino badge, as was then customary for Maranello cars not equipped with a V12 engine. The 308 GT4 completed the range, which already included the 246 GT and GTS, until they went out of production. The digits in the name referred to the engine’s cubic capacity and to the number of cylinders, in this case three litres and eight respectively, while the four signified that it was a four-seater. The car had two rear seats even though it was only 4.3 metres long. Compact with a powerful heart, it used the available space cleverly. It hosted a 2996 cc and 255 hp V8 engine at 90°, centrally mounted in front of the rear axle and with a top speed of 250 km/h. The Dino also had rear-wheel drive and a 5-speed gearbox. It was produced between 1974 and 1978.

With regard to the Technical Department, Mauro Forghieri regained full power and, with it, the freedom to propose new and innovative solutions. The team’s Team Principle was twenty-six-year-old Luca di Montezemolo, while the drivers were Clay Regazzoni, returning to Ferrari after a year spent with the BRM team, and the young Austrian, Niki Lauda, also from BRM. Indeed, it was Regazzoni who recommended Lauda to Enzo Ferrari, after witnessing him in action over the course of their shared year with BRM. According to Regazzoni, Lauda had great potential, making him preferable not only to Jean-Pierre Jarier, but also to Peter Revson and James Hunt. At any rate, Enzo Ferrari’s famed foresight and courage when it comes to choosing young talent was no less evident on this occasion. The introduction of a dedicated team of mechanics for each driver was another new development that year. Clay’s chief mechanic was Giulio Borsari, while Niki’s was Ermanno Cuoghi. The car – the 312 B3 – was a successful design: its most noticeable characteristic was the striking air intake, located directly behind the driver’s helmet, which was painted red with a white band half way up. Those colours echoed those of the flag of Niki Lauda’s home country, as well as alluding to Clay Regazzoni’s Swiss heritage… Right from the start, the 312-B3 proved highly competitive, and in its first ever race in Argentina, Lauda and Regazzoni made it onto the podium in second and third place. Regazzoni came second in Brazil, before the car’s crowning moment in Spain, at the Jarama circuit just outside Madrid. There Niki Lauda took his first Formula 1 victory, taking home a 50th win for the Scuderia Ferrari since the start of the F1 championship. Regazzoni came second, completing Ferrari’s glorious winning streak. In Jarama, Lauda reigned supreme, taking pole position and completing the fastest lap in the race. The start of the race was hit by rain, and the positions changed continually, with the wet-track specialist Ronnie Peterson taking the lead. Around halfway through, the weather changed, and a pit stop for tyre changes served to mix things up. Ferrari’s mechanics completed Lauda’s pitstop in just 35 seconds, a remarkable time for 1974."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"6d460a72-0828-430e-a0cb-313f78bebe71"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Very quickly, the Austrian successfully regained the lead, going on to win more than 35 seconds ahead of his team-mate, who started third on the grid.

The new 312 T was not ready for the start of the season, but the drivers were the same as before, and the 312-B3 was nonetheless more than capable of ensuring a sufficient degree of competitiveness. Or it least this was the general view held. In reality, in the opening races in both Argentina and Brazil, the competition succeeded in closing the gap, and the Ferrari team had to content itself with finishing in the points, with two fourth places for the moustachioed pilot from Lugano, and a fifth and a sixth place for the Austrian. This somewhat meagre outcome did not live up to expectations. The new Goodyear compounds were not suited to the old B3, so Ferrari asked his technical staff to speed up the preparation of the new car, with a view to debuting it in South Africa. In comparison to the older model, the 312 T was completely new. While it was still equipped with the boxer engine, the new car featured a transverse gearbox mounted in front of the rear wheels, as signified by the “T” in the name of the model. The goal was to move the weight balance forward as far as possible, rendering the car shorter and easier to handle. In side view, the car had a noticeable wedge shape, while the engine air intake remained prominent, albeit now finished in white with the colours of the Italian flag. New suspension all round contributed to improving the performance of the tyres, and the large overhanging rear spoiler was also completely redesigned. In South Africa, the cars were still not entirely up to standard, and lacked reliability, although Lauda came in fifth. In the test days at Kyalami after the GP, however, Lauda succeeded in lapping faster than the time set for the race’s pole position. And he then took the car’s first win at the BRDC International Trophy (a non-championship race) at Silverstone."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"98be2f43-2a72-4849-9622-c646fa01091d"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"In Spain, Lauda took the pole position, but during the race both drivers were caught up in an accident, Lauda being eliminated straight away while Regazzoni made it back to the pits for repairs, only not to classify in the race results.

Lauda showed how meticulous he could be in the fine-tuning of the car and how good he was at choosing tyres, and went on to achieve a series of superb victories that lead him to the top of the standings. He won three races in a row in Monaco, Belgium and Sweden, and took second place in Holland before coming in first again in France. Lauda then went on to take two third places in Germany and Italy, consolidating his lead in the standings and taking the World\nChampion title before the last race. The season closed with a bang in the US, with yet another victory in a nation that was strategic for Ferrari with regard to the sale of the road cars. Regazzoni also had a good season, finishing first at Monza, taking two podium placings in Germany and France, and closing the season in fifth place overall in the Drivers’rankings, thus helping to win the Constructors’ Championship for Ferrari. Lauda’s dominance was further underlined by the nine pole positions and two lap records added to his list of achievements.

Lauda took his first win of 1977 in the tragic South African Grand Prix, which was rocked by the death of Tom Pryce. The British driver was killed instantly when he was struck by a heavy fire extinguisher being carried by a marshal, as he rushed across the track to deal with a fire in Renzo Zorzi’s Shadow. Unfortunately, after the incident, Pryce’s car continued down the straight and hit the Ligier of Lafitte who was braking into the first corner. Fortunately, the French driver emerged unscathed from the collision. Mario Andretti drove the Lotus to victory at Long Beach, while Lauda racked up good points by delivering three second-place finishes in four races. In France, despite finishing a modest fifth, he took the lead in the championship and held onto it for the rest of the season. Thanks to the latest modifications, the 312 T2 was an almost-perfect car and the very determined Austrian did not put a foot wrong. Car number 11, in fact, won at Hockenheim in Germany in what felt like an exorcism of the accident at the Nürburgring 12 months previously, and then did so again in Holland. It also took secured second-place finishes in Great Britain, Austria and Italy. Thanks to Lauda’s podium position at Monza, Ferrari sealed the Constructors’ Cup with three races remaining in the season. The Italian crowd went wild, in part because the top step was occupied by a former, and still-much loved Ferrari driver, Mario Andretti, who was then with Lotus.

However, once the battle for the world title was over, Lauda and Enzo Ferrari’s very different perspectives came to the fore. The Austrian felt that much of the credit for the victory was due to his skills and asked for a substantial raise, something Ferrari would not grant.

Lauda went to Canada but refused to take part to the race weekend, declaring that the car didn’t have the potential to win at Mosport Park.

However, the British team was highly motivated because it wanted to dedicate a victory to Ronnie Peterson, who died following an accident at the Monza Grand Prix. There were many driver changes to come in 1979 – it was Carlos Reutemann’s last race for the Scuderia before he joined Lotus, while for Wolf, Jody Scheckter was on his way out. His future was at Ferrari, where he would partner Gilles Villeneuve. The Canadian stayed on despite being outclassed by Reutemann. The Argentinian fought with the Brabham of Niki Lauda for third place in the world championship, winning in Brazil, Long Beach, the UK and Watkins Glen. Villeneuve however collected just eight points, with a third in Austria, a fourth in Belgium and sixth in the Netherlands. But Enzo Ferrari believed in him and decided to give him another chance. The Ferraris led in the first sessions, held in the pouring rain, although Jean-Pierre Jarier, who had replaced Peterson at Lotus, got the better of them in qualifying. Scheckter was second, followed by Villeneuve. On race day, the track was wet and the mercury below zero. Jarier led, followed by Jones, who shot from fifth to second, then Scheckter and Villeneuve. The leading Lotus was very fast and pulled away, while Jones increasingly struggled to keep behind the Scuderia pair for 1979.

The race leader was forced to slow down noticeably earlier than usual. The Frenchman still led for a while despite the death throws of the Lotus braking system, but he was eventually forced to make a sad return to the pits. Villeneuve, watched by Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, led the Canadian Grand Prix – a first. Gilles was out in front for the fourth time in his career. The first was at Long Beach, when he came off track in a misguided attempt to lap Clay Regazzoni. He had been in the lead for a few laps in Austria and many more in the tragic Italian Grand Prix, where he was penalised a minute for jumping the start. Villeneuve feared that something would go wrong again and after the race spoke about those moments and said, “Those last laps were torture. I could hear all kinds of noises in the car. […] I was having to drive like an old woman, shifting at 10,000rpm instead of 11,500 and I just kept saying to myself: Ferrari is the best. It doesn’t break. It never breaks!” The first Canadian Grand Prix held in Quebec concluded half an hour later and it was the Ferrari of Gilles first past the chequered flag.

A month later the Formula 1 Championship moved to Scheckter’s home territory, and this time Ferrari introduced the new 312 T4. Jean-Pierre Jabouille took pole in qualifying at Kyalami but the Renault proved fragile, and both he and René Arnoux were forced to retire, opening the way for a Ferrari one-two finish. Villeneuve beat Scheckter to the line by just over three seconds and then repeated that feat at Long Beach to bounce to the top of the standings. Back in Europe, Ligier triumphed in Spain but while Scheckter finished in fourth place, Villeneuve didn’t get any points. The same thing happened again in Belgium where Scheckter won to join Laffite at the top of the standings. Two weeks later, the South African got the upper hand in the drivers’ rankings, thanks to his win at Monaco, also putting Ferrari at the top of the Constructors’ points. On July 1, Villeneuve and Arnoux wrote one of the most brilliant pages in Formula 1 history with a sparkling duel between the Ferrari and Renault cars in the final laps of the French GP. In the end, the French constructor won its first Grand Prix with Jabouille, but all eyes were on the battle for second place as Gilles and René continually swapped positions, delivering one brilliant pass after another and going wheel to wheel to the very last second.

In a manoeuvre that no other driver would even have attempted he passed Jones on the outside at the Tarzan Corner on lap 11, but picked up a puncture and had to drive a full lap on three wheels before being forced to pull off the track.

Ferrari’s technical gamble centred not so much around the performance guaranteed by the turbocharged engines but the fact that the car’s acceleration and handling were so ill-suited to the torturous Monegasque circuit.","excerpt":"","audioId":"653a7351-3cae-4cfb-a4d9-7ac9891b9bc3","background":{"landscapeBig":"5d06843c3ad9250aee5324d6","portraitMedium":"5d068467107b060e8f527a89"},"backgroundMobile":{"landscapeMedium":"5d06843c3ad9250aee5324d6","portraitMedium":"5d068467107b060e8f527a89"},"blocks":[{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d06843c3ad9250aee5324d6","portraitMedium":"5d06848a107b060e8f527a8a"}},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Nonetheless, the Canadian and his Ferrari 126 CK went on to write a whole new chapter in Formula 1 history on the city circuit. This was the first Monaco Grand Prix to be won by a turbo engine, the first victory for a Ferrari turbo-engined car, the first win too after a gap of year and a half. All in all, it broke the hex, and put both Gilles and the Ferrari car back at centre stage. Of all the victories Gilles delivered in the course of his career, Monaco was probably the least spectacular or memorable. That said, there was still something special about it because just before the weekend, Ferrari announced that its partnership with Villeneuve would continue for a further two seasons. Qualifying went very well for the Canadian whose driving seemed inspired from the outset. He even started from the first row alongside Piquet on pole who’d qualified just 78 thousandths faster in the Brabham. The race started an hour late because water used by the fire services to put out a blaze in the kitchens of the Loews Hotel flooded the tunnel. Once it did begin, however, Nelson Piquet quickly broke away from the pack along the torturous 3.312 km track. The 1981 Monaco Grand Prix proved something of an elimination race. In the course of the 76 scheduled laps, many of the drivers came to grief, including the Brazilian who crashed out as he attempted to lap Cheever and Tambay. Reigning World Champion Alan Jones took the lead and looked set for a comfortable victory as he held a 30-second-plus lead over his nearest rival, Villeneuve. But then, just seven laps from the finish, the Williams driver had to pit because of a fuel feed problem. When he returned to the race, he was still in the lead but now had to deal with pressure from Villeneuve who had scented victory and began delivering one race fastest lap after another. The Canadian pushed his Ferrari nearer and nearer the limit corner after corner, driving near and nearer the guardrails every lap. But the driver who’d earned himself the nickname “the Aviator” for his many spectacular accidents, never put a foot wrong. He had fun with the rolling Monegasque circuit, unleashing his car’s power through the tunnel and all the way to the Tabac before waltzing it through audacious race lines between the Mirabeau and the Loews Hairpin."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"e920ae1b-e57e-4650-a67a-8828a9ccd2a0"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"Four laps from the finish, Villeneuve had the tail of Jones’ William firmly in his sights.

The Ferrari driver continued to press on and, thanks to the fact that his rival developed a fuel pump problem, shot across the finish-line to victory more than 40 seconds ahead of the rest of the field. Villeneuve was visibly exhausted on the podium but photographs of his beaming face as he was sprayed with champagne, went around the world like wildfire.

The weight of the 308 GTB was reduced by the use of aluminium and fibreglass in its construction instead of steel. The first model, with the chassis no. 8380, left the Padua workshop in 1978. Eleven were built up to 1984 while one was put together by a craftsman in the UK. Its first victory came in 1979 at the Monza Rally, with Raffaele “Lele” Pinto and Claudio Penariol. Two years later, the Ferrari 308 Gr4 won the first of two victories in the Tour de France Automobile, with Jean-Claude Andruet driving it for Charles Pozzi’s team, for which the versatile Frenchman had also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1972 with the 365 GTB/4. Chantal Bouchetal was his navigator in the Tour de France. Andruet repeated the feat in 1982, a great year for the 308 Gr4 .He had another woman at his side, known as “Biche”, but whose real name was Michele Espinosi-Petit. Pioneer’s sponsorship brought a change of colour from red to blue and the car was so beautiful that in 2016 a customer wanted his Ferrari 488 in the same colours. The car, produced by Tailor Made Ferrari, was unveiled to the public at the Grand Palais, at the annual re-enactment of the French race. The 308 Gr4 also won the constructors’ and drivers’ titles of the 1982 Italian Rally Championship, with Tonino Tognana and Massimo De Antoni in the Jolly Club team car. The season was very hard fought, opening with a win at the Targa Florio in March. It was actually a double victory, because Andruet and “Biche” finished second. Tognana and De Antoni triumphed again in the Ciocco Rally, while at Collina Romagna they secured an important second place, behind the Lancia of Fabrizio Tabaton and Luciano Tedeschini. The third victory of the season came in September, this time in the Piancavallo Rally in the province of Pordenone.

Priority was given to customers on the West Coast of the US, especially California, where the very first vehicles in the series were sent. After that, production began for the European market. Pininfarina masterfully succeeded in giving the soft-top car the same silhouette as the coupé version. The soft-top model was anchored at the base of the two uprights of the rear window, folding into a concealed compartment behind the rear seats separated by an armrest, despite that area also housing the engine. At that time, the technology for manual soft-tops was yet to be developed. That is why the roof was rather complex and delicate to handle, in order to avoid causing damage when folding. That said, from an aesthetic point of view the Mondial Cabriolet was a success. Like the coupé, the Cabriolet was restyled twice, in 1985 and 1989, giving rise to the Mondial 3.2 and Mondial T.

This design stands out for its original stylistic solutions, such as different width between the front and rear track, or the repetition of the grilling of the side air intakes on the fascia covering the rear lights, but now rectangular rather than round. Although the Testarossa played with the concept of different volumes at the front and rear of the car, the final result is particularly harmonious and indeed unique. This choice was purely technical and showed once again how Ferrari puts style at the service of mechanical solutions. The designers of the Testarossa created an “unbalanced” layout on the rear, placing the radiators there in order to eliminate the hot water pipes. Pininfarina transformed a potential limitation into an opportunity and created a shape that could convey the flow along the sides where the radiators were positioned. To hide them from view, the designer came up with the car’s iconic stretch of horizontal spoilers that fit harmoniously into the three-dimensional shapes of the tail."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"7910afdd-af80-4c58-9b43-18dd23ffd317"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"However, it was not just the style that left people speechless.

The project was headed by a heavy design hitter Mauro Forghieri. After leaving Ferrari’s GES division to devote himself to advanced research, the designer used the 308 GTB’s running gear as his starting point, bestowing it with some very surprising solutions derived directly from Formula 1. A very successful attempt to meld the mid-rear-engined sports car concept with the very finest technology of the day, the GTO turned out to be extreme on every level. In fact, it was the first car to be built using innovative composites – Kevlar, for example, was used for the bodyshell. It is also the first production car with Formula 1-derived electronic fuel injection which boosted the delivery of the 400 hp generated by its V8 engine. Its displacement was also cut to 2,855cc, to comply with Group B rules, and sported twin IHI turbochargers and intercoolers, one per cylinder bank, just like the Formula 1 single-seaters. The GTO also unleashed a spectacular top speed of 305 km/h, making it quite literally uncatchable by any other production car of the day. Because of its close links to Formula 1, Ferrari also involved its two Scuderia drivers for the 1984 season, René Arnoux and Michele Alboreto, in its development. In fact, Enzo Ferrari frequently appeared more interested in how the GTO’s development was progressing rather than that year’s Formula 1 car, the Ferrari 126 C4. The GTO was something of a throwback to the glorious competition Gran Turismos of the past, even though the FISA abolished Group B before the car could race. The car’s name also references the 250 GTO, probably the most iconic car in Prancing Horse history. Its Pininfarina styling was inspired by the lines of the 308 GTB and the aerodynamic study for the 308 GTB Speciale, better known as the “Millechiodi”.\n\n\n\n"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"4f8eb085-f8cf-4d4b-bde3-8dc496e9f529"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"However, it pushed those lines and forms to new extremes to make them as aerodynamically efficient as they were aggressive.

The Scuderia’s sporting director Marco Piccinini travelled to the US to watch several races and had talks with the organisers of the series. In Maranello, a work group headed by young Austrian engineer Gustav Brunner was set up specifically for it. From the outset, however, it was clear that the project would only be successful if Ferrari collaborated with teams that regularly competed in the CART championship. Leo Mehl, a motor racing executive at Goodyear, which manufactured Ferrari’s F1 tyres and was also the sole supplier for the US series, recommended the Truesport team. It had turned its 1985 CART season around in the final six races which Bobby Rahal won in the March 85C. The latter was a successful driver in the US but had also competed in two F1 Grands Prix at the end of the 1970s for Wolf. This was also the single-seater that was used as the starting point for the development of the new Ferrari. After a secret test carried out by Michele Alboreto at Fiorano, Brunner’s team which included, amongst others, Harvey Postlethwaite andAntonio Bellentani, threw itself into developing the car and, in doing so, came up with original and entirely innovative takes on certain technical concepts then in vogue in the US championships. Brunner studied, researched, experimented and spent endless hours in the wind tunnel, honing the forms and aerodynamics of the single-seater. He also made many trips to the US and watched both CART races and tests, not least the Indy500. The results of the research conducted back in Maranello were promising too and the project ploughed ahead at full steam. A year later, in September 1986, the 637 was ready for the track and Alboreto was, once again, selected to do the testing. The single-seater instantly proved competitive and, above all, was radically different from the other cars in the series. Its nosecone in particular featured lines and solutions that would not be seen elsewhere for many years to come. A member of the international press was also invited to the tests as Ferrari wanted to be sure his message to the FIA arrived loud and clear."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"57277215-0fbe-4272-97dd-aca1d30eca79"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"The ploy worked and negotiations were soon underway with the Federation, marking a political victory for Ferrari who confirmed that the Scuderia was committed to continuing in Formula 1.

That said, Ferrari also wanted the F40 to deliver a uniquely powerful emotional impact on more than just its drivers. The F40 was the state-of-the-art in terms of its power, thanks to a twin-turbo 90° V8 engine that generated almost 160 CV/litre by virtue of twin intercoolers and IHI turbos, punching out a total of 478 CV. An engineering masterpiece supported by a central integrated tubular steel and composite structure of a kind previously only used in the Formula 1 single-seaters. This solution worked well with a tubular steel chassis to which Kevlar reinforcement panels were bonded guaranteeing three times the torsional rigidity of a regular road car. The result was that the F40 weighed just 1,100 kg. This fact combined with a set-up and suspensions adjustable to three different heights to suit different speeds, guaranteed the model astonishing road-holding and extreme performance figures, most notably a top speed of 324 km/h and 0 to 100 km/h acceleration in just 4.1 seconds."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"f0babe4f-d49b-4e5e-bcc9-ada1c7fa278d"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Enzo Ferrari’s final and definitive car’s styling was, of course, well on a par with its technological prowess.

On 14 January, accompanied by his loyal driver Dino Tagliazucchi, he went to the Maranello town hall for a very important meeting. He and the Mayor of Modena, Alfonsina Rinaldi, signed the papers authorising the demolition of the old Scuderia headquarters in Viale Trento e Trieste. A little over two weeks later he made his final public appearance, when on 1 February he received an honorary physics degree from the University of Modena. The ceremony took place at the city hall and what struck the keenest observers present was that Ferrari looked exhausted. It seemed that the years had finally begun to catch up with him. Just over two weeks later he celebrated his 90th birthday, an event that gives us a good idea of how the founder saw things. There was to be no public ceremony, no authorities invited to participate, but simply a “family event” open “to people on the payroll,” as Ferrari ordered. The family sat down to eat on the production lines with about 1700 people, with a huge field kitchen outside. Employees received a model of the F40, the last car personally signed off by Ferrari, along with a silver commemorative medal. The menu was typically Emilian: ham, sausage, cracklings, mortadella, fried dumplings and pickled vegetables as an hors d’oeuvres accompanied by Malvasia wine; tortellini pasta with cream and lasagne for the first course and Zampone of Modena with beans and a veal cutlet with baked vegetables for the main.

It was tried and tested in Formula 1 and is now standard on all self-respecting sports cars. Thirty years ago, however, this was far from the case. In fact, the mere idea was unimaginable. Back in 1979, the Scuderia had developed an electrohydraulic gearbox and tested it on a 312 T3 laboratory car. Rather than the traditional gear lever inside the cockpit, Ferrari’s unique system used two buttons on the steering wheel to change the gears. The buttons activated electromagnetic valves that, in turn, activated actuators in the gearbox. However, the advanced electronics required to make the system work were not yet available and it was mothballed. That said, the experiment was not in vain. Ten years later, now armed with new technology, Ferrari went down the same route and, in the process, ushered in a whole new era in Formula 1, courtesy of the revolutionary F1-89 (design no. 640), the brainchild of John Barnard. A car that was, to all intents and purposes, the first of the present generation of electronically-managed single-seaters. The new F1-89 sported an innovative aerodynamic body, push-rod suspension with torsion bars, and the latest iteration of the naturally-aspirated V12 which punched out 600 bhp at 12,000 rpm.

The Frenchman was fourth, behind the two McLarens of former Ferrari driver Gerhard Berger and Senna. The tyres were the main concern ahead of the race, with the fear that two pit stops would be needed to complete the race. But one previously insignificant team had an ace up its sleeve. Leyton House, formerly March, had a car that adhered so tightly to the regulations that drivers Ivan Capelli and Mauricio Gugelmin failed even to qualify in Mexico. The designer, 27-year-old Adrian Newey, had just left the team, but before leaving he introduced an aerodynamic update on the CG901 that really suited the Le Castellet track. While all the teams were concentrated on finishing the race on only one stop, Leyton House was preparing a coup: to finish the race without a pit stop. At the start Berger overtook Mansell while Senna was third ahead of Prost. The early part of the race was slow and it was the tyre changes that made the difference. Prost’s car came into the pits on Lap 26 and set off again seven seconds later. Shortly after, Mansell also stopped while the McLarens stayed out until after lap 30. Senna overtook Berger who lost 12 seconds in the pits, not a good stop but it was nothing compared to what Senna would lose – 16 seconds – on his later pit stop.

The design of the tail and the cockpit also drew inspiration from the “Daytona” – the car’s shape is quite modern but contains classic elements referring to the history of the company. The motorised spoiler underneath the tail panel provides a special, almost imperceptible aerodynamic effect: its angle of incidence varies depending on the speed and acts on the downforce of the car. As with all other models in the range, the car was designed from the outset for all world markets, with a specific version for the American market. However, while previous GT 2+2 models could come with an automatic transmission, the 456 GT was initially offered only with manual transmission.

Just a year later, the idea took shape of creating a high-level single-make championship. Contact was made with the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) to guarantee the highest standards of safety would be met. Ferrari also entered into talks with some of Italy and Europe’s finest and most spectacularly beautiful circuits to allow clients to compete on suitably atmospheric tracks. From the very earliest stage of the rule drafting process, it was decided to allow only official Ferrari dealerships to compete to guarantee absolute transparency in performance terms. The Prancing Horse officially announced the launch of the Ferrari Challenge at Mugello in the autumn of 1992. It would span an Italian and a European series, each comprising six rounds of which the final one would be shared. On that same day, Ferrari also unveiled the TB and TS versions of the 348 Challenge, the car chosen for the series. In line with the tradition of allowing road cars to be converted into racing versions, the 348 was equipped with a special kit which, once removed, returned the car to its original configuration. The kit comprised a roll cage, six-point safety harnesses, 18” magnesium wheels, a fire extinguisher, front and rear tow hooks, and an electric circuit breaker. The 348 Challenge’s engine unleashed 320 horses, 20 or so more than the road version. The brakes too were boosted. The Italian series was first to debut with its maiden round getting underway at Monza on March 28. The first ever Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli race was won by Paolo Rossi in car no. 5, an almost fluorescent 348. Race 2 was won by Roberto Ragazzi who went on to become the Ferrari Challenge’s first champion at the end of the season. The first round of the European series, on the other hand, took place at Magny-Cours, just a week later and both races were dominated by Bernd Hahne, brother of 1970s Formula 1 driver, Hubert. The German also won the first European title and triumphed at the Finalissima at Mugello. The Ferrari single-make championship proved such an instant international success that it was decided to launch a North American series in 1994. Celebrities of the likes of singer Eros Ramazzotti and sports personalities such as skier Kristian Ghedina frequently appear in the Italian and European series.

Obviously Ferrari technicians profoundly revised and optimised the unit fitted to the F512 M, particularly in terms of its thermodynamic characteristics and kinematics, with undoubted benefits for maximum power, now increased to 440 hp. The increase in power provided improved acceleration over the previous model and, because various parts of the car were now lighter, there was also a better power to weight ratio. The letter “M” that appears next to the F512, and that indicates the “Modified” version of the car, was no mere marketing operation, but emphasises the in-depth work carried out on every part of the model. This can be seen, for example, in the improved aerodynamic penetration, achieved through big changes to the lines and the shape both at the nose and the tail. However, the Pininfarina designers and Maranello engineers focussed mainly on the front.\n"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"1c80242d-97d7-4d2a-9ea3-548b7e02df00"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"The new nose line was closely related to that of the 355 model and with the style of the 456 GT 2 + 2.

However, Formula 1’s direct influence wasn’t limited solely to the engine (the 12-cylinder sported by the 640 and 641 fielded by Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost, albeit boosted from 3,500 to 4,698 cc), it also impacted the car’s overall concept. Just like the single-seater, the engine was a weight-bearing member with the push-rod rear suspension mated to it. The front suspensions, which attached to the carbon-fibre chassis, were inspired by those of the 1980s 126 C too. The use of cutting-edge materials also pointed to the F50’s close links with the Formula 1 cars.. The engineers used everything from carbon-fibre to titanium for the con rods and front hubs, and magnesium and aluminium alloy for the wheel rims. The rear hubs, on the other hand, adopted a solution invented and patented by Ferrari for its single-seaters that reduces power loss. Crafted once again by Pininfarina, the F50’s styling took 2,000 hours of wind tunnel testing to perfect and effortlessly combined iconic styling features with extreme technical and aerodynamic demands.

It looked like the race would start behind the Safety Car but at the last moment the race director decided that it could go ahead as normal. The cars set off gingerly over the soaking wet Catalan asphalt, and Schumacher had one of the worst starts, slipping to seventh place by the first corner, behind his team-mate Eddie Irvine. Meanwhile, the race director’s decision proved way off the mark with five cars retiring in the first lap alone. Irvine joined them on the second lap, going into a spin and his engine stalling. On lap 3 Schumacher was already in a battle with the Benetton of Gerhard Berger for fourth place, although the duel quickly became one for third place because, in the meantime, race leader Hill had spun.

Indeed, the F355 Berlinetta was the first car with a shape that optimised the disposal and control of the air flows in the underbody, ensuring a constant interaction between the vehicle and the ground to the advantage of road holding. The engine itself was the subject of study and transfer of technology from the track, providing the F355 with extremely high performance: 109 hp/litre. Specific power and torque were the result of the adoption of a head with five valves per cylinder and electronic fuel injection. On top of this already superb base, Ferrari decided to introduce a revolutionary element from Formula 1: a semi-automatic gearbox with steering wheel controls. This technological innovation was developed for single-seaters as early as 1979, thanks to Mauro Forghieri’s intuition, but was only brought to the track in 1989 when Nigel Mansell and his 640 F1 won in Brazil, in its debut season.

The work took a year and a half and while obviously the primary aim of a wind tunnel is efficiency, it is equally true that Ferrari, the icon of style, would hardly settle for a conventional and inelegant structure. So the project thus came to involve one of the world’s most famous architects, an Italian and native of Genoa, Renzo Piano. The giant simulator stands on undulating ground in the area where the new Ferrari citadel was to be constructed, with beautifully designed and highly efficient buildings. Piano decided to leave the structure exposed to bring out its technical components, such as the engines required to generate the airflow, conceiving the tunnel as a giant tubular duct closed at each end by a C-section, 80 by 70 metres… As already said, the new wind tunnel can handle 1:2 models, simulating speeds approaching 250 km/h, or it can accommodate the real car itself (1:1 model) at speeds of up to 150 km/h. The electrical substation that feeds the system contains 6000 kW installations, enough power to light about 2000 apartments. The fan is about five metres in diameter and is equipped with a 2200 kW turbine, the equivalent of five Formula 1 engines.

The season opened in Melbourne, Australia, where reigning champions McLaren monopolised the front row. Unfortunately Michael Schumacher’s championship began in the same way that 1998 had concluded. Clutch trouble caused his engine to stall on the grid meaning he had to start from the back. The McLarens surged ahead, only to break down one after the other within a few laps. The race was won by Ferrari͛s Eddie Irvine – the first in his career. What everyone was eagerly anticipating, however, was the duel between Mika Hakkinen and Michael Schumacher who were back in the mix from the next race. The Finnish McLaren driver won in Brazil, but the German triumphed at Imola, in front of ecstatic fans, and Monaco, where Ferrari pulled off a one-two. Hakkinen took victory in Spain and again in Canada where Schumacher ended his race after colliding with the ͚Wall of Champions͛. The rain-soaked French GP instead saw an outsider, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, take the flag in the Jordan. The British Grand Prix took place on 11 July, at Silverstone. The two McLarens led at the start, pursued by Irvine and Schumacher. Jacques Villeneuve and Alex Zanardi were stuck on the grid so the race was red flagged. However, the front-runners were now at Stowe corner, where Schumacher tried an attack on Irvine. But Schumacher had a brake problem, which caused him to crash into the tyre wall at high speed. He immediately tried to pull himself out of the cockpit, but he quickly realised his right leg was injured and let himself drop back into the car. The impact had broken his tibia and fibula.

Eddie still led though, two points ahead of Hakkinen. In the next three races Salo and Irvine collected a miserly eight and four points respectively, but that was enough for the McLaren driver to regain the championship lead with only two races to go. Schumacher made his big come-back in Malaysia, and after taking pole position acted as the perfect team driver by letting Irvine pass at the start while slowing Hakkinen down and forcing him into third place. Irvine arrived for the finale in Japan, two weeks later, with a four-point lead, the same that Ferrari held over McLaren in the Constructors’ championship. Eddie’s weekend immediately became complicated. He left the track disastrously during qualifying, dropping him down on the grid. Schumacher took pole but Hakkinen overtook him at the start. Schumacher managed to keep to within just a few seconds of the Finn, but was unable to pull of an attack that would have made Irvine’s third place count. Hakkinen won the world championship, with Irvine just two points behind. Ferrari could at least count on the Constructors’ title, its first in many years.

At the A1 Ring he was bumped by the BAR of Ricardo Zonta sending him into a spin and into the path of the Jordan of Jarno Trulli who he couldn’t avoid, while in Germany the Benetton of Giancarlo Fisichella collided with him. With zero points from three races Coulthard and Hakkinen were just two points behind the Ferrari driver. The Scuderia was kept afloat by Barrichello who at Hockenheim, after starting in 18th, won his first victory in Formula 1 racing with dry tyres despite the rain falling on half the almost seven kilometres of track. Hakkinen won at the Hungaroring beating Michael and taking two-point lead on him in the standings. The next race was at Spa-Francorchamps. The Finn dominated in qualifying and took command at the start of the race on a drying track. On lap 13 Hakkinen spun after his wheels slid on a wet white stripe: Schumacher took advantage to move into the lead. At that point, the McLaren driver launched a furious comeback and was right on the tail of the Ferrari with eight laps to go. The first US Grand Prix on the new circuit in the Indianapolis basin raised great hopes for Ferrari. With a one-two and the withdrawal of Hakkinen, Schumacher moved into an eight-point lead. Michael took pole on 8 October in Japan, but Hakkinen pulled ahead at the start. He needed to remedy the situation with strategy because it is nigh on impossible to overtake on the track.

The British driver would prove to be Schumacher’s only real rival that season as he turned consistency into his greatest strength. Michael was forced to retire from the race at Imola but then won both the Spanish Grand Prix and the European GP at the Nürburgring. Often that year he found himself doing battle with his younger brother, Ralf, who himself had become one of the top drivers in the sport, racing for Williams. His team-mate, Columbian Juan Pablo Montoya, would engage the Ferrari driver in some spectacular duels too in the course of the season. Michael Schumacher, however, took a definitive lead in the title race at the French Grand Prix which he won ahead of Coulthard who finished third. At that point in the season, the German had a 31-point lead over his rival – the equivalent of three grands prix. The results in the Constructors’ standings looked even more promising. Thanks to Barrichello who, although he wasn’t winning, often featured on the podium, Ferrari had racked up 108 points compared to McLaren’s 56.On August 19, holidaymakers everywhere clustered around TVs showing the Formula 1 action.

Many of the drivers felt that the grand prix should not go ahead, particularly as both titles had already been won, but the FOM insisted they all race. As a mark of respect and mourning, Ferrari removed all sponsor logos from its cars and uniforms, and painted the single-seaters’ nosecones black.

Ferrari was so ahead of the game, in fact, that the Scuderia fielded the previous year’s F2001 in the first round of the season in Australian. At that point, the team was still lapping the F2002 back at Fiorano to improve its reliability. But on the performance front there was no issue at all. It was already delivering. And how… Schumacher won the Australian Grand Prix and was second in Malaysia in the F2001 before debuting the new car which proceeded to win its maiden race at the demanding Interlagos Circuit . At Imola, Barrichello, who’d had a very unlucky season thus far, was also given an F2002, and he and Schumacher immediately delivered their first one-two finish of the season. The German champion then went on to win in Spain, Austria, Canada and Great Britain, while his rivals took turns standing beside him on the podium, nabbing points from each other in the process. Barrichello, for his part, won the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. By the time the French Grand Prix came around, Michael had a 54-point lead over Juan Pablo Montoya of Williams. The race started out as a three-pronged sparring match between Montoya, Schumacher and a young McLaren driver called Kimi Räikkönen. Michael attacked Montoya but the Finn passed him at the Adelaide hairpin. Räikkönen looked set for victory when, five laps from the finish, he locked up and went wide after hitting oil from Olivier Panis’Toyota. Schumacher took very shrewd advantage and shot past the McLaren to be first over the line. That victory combined with his rivals’ results, gave him his fifth World Drivers’ title, equalling the record set by 1950s racing hero Juan Manuel Fangio. It was still only July 21 but the game was over. Ferrari had to wait until the Hungarian GP on August 18 to secure the Constructors’ title.

Victory seemed assured in the Monaco Grand Prix but then the Monte-Carlo roulette wheel spun and stopped instead on number seven, Jarno Trulli. In fact, a paradoxical incident put Schumacher out of the race while the Safety Car was deployed. The Ferrari driver was in the lead, but alternating between accelerating and braking to keep the brakes of his F2004 warm. Inside, the tunnel there was a misunderstanding with Juan Pablo Montoya. To avoid hitting the Ferrari, the Williams driver hung a sharp right. Schumacher, who had not noticed him, also swung right. A collision was inevitable and the German’s car ended up against the barrier, wrecking his front suspension. It was, however, just a blip as Michael immediately returned to obliterating the competition from the next race, the European Grand Prix, at the Nürburgring on May 30. His victory in the Eiffel Mountains marked the start of a string of seven triumphs, ending at the Hungarian Grand Prix in mid-August. The most memorable of these included the French Grand Prix on July 4. At this point, Ferrari’s strategists had blind faith in Michael’s ability to beat the Renault of Fernando Alonso, and decided on a four-stop strategy."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"45695711-21f0-44a2-88a2-cd69dc70516b"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"To win, Schumacher would have to drive almost 70 laps as hard as if he were in qualifying.

However, Schumacher had to wait until the following GP in Belgium, for his seventh title, an achievement that no other driver has ever even come close to equalling. The legendary German driver was second behind the McLaren of Kimi Räikkönen on the day, but it mattered not a whit: he had clinched the title a full five races before the end of the season. Schumacher and Barrichello, who won in Italy and also took the very first GP ever staged in China, triumphed in 15 out of 18 races that season, absolutely obliterating the competition and setting a slew of new records. Michael took 82% of the available points. He finished the season 34 points ahead of Barrichello and a massive 63 in front of Button. Ferrari was the undisputed king of Formula 1. It had won every Constructors’ Cup since 1999, while Schumacher had delivered five consecutive Drivers’titles since 2000, a feat that made him far and away the most successful driver not just in Ferrari, but also Formula 1 history.

The main surface of the roof was made of an electrochemical glass panel allowing the driver to operate a dashboard control that could adjust the amount of light inside the car from 4 to 40%. The roof had another special feature too – designed by Fioravanti – using of a rolling mechanism for its opening. Made out of carbon fibre, it was very light, causing minimal variance in the centre of gravity between its closed and open configurations. The new roof concept, integrated with electrochromic glass technology applied to large glass surfaces, enabled the car to morph in seconds from coupè to convertible, adding the functional advantages of the coupè to the traditional advantages of open-top models. Ferrari first used the name Superamerica between 1956 and 1961. It marked a number of models, all strictly 12-cylinder and produced in limited series. This model was no exception. Built on the base of the 575M Maranello, the Superamerica used what was then the latest development of the Ferrari 12-cylinder engine, boosted to 540 hp. The full integration of the roof opening system and the electrically actuated kinematics made the Superamerica the world’s fastest convertible, with a top speed of 320 km/h. The styling of the Ferrari Superamerica, entrusted to Pininfarina, made it possible to respect the balance of volumes typical of a Maranello 12-cylinder engine, while at the same time providing an original integration of the car’s most distinctive function: the “Revochromic” roof. This innovative component connected to the car body thanks to its two side fins that refer to Ferraris of the past and that, in the Superamerica, also serve the roll-bar function in synergy with the roof and windscreen.\n"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"fe78ba81-417c-4ff3-ae3e-b0d67e25e384"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"The front view stood out thanks to the new look of the headlight covers and the air intake on the bonnet, both were aluminium in colour.

McLaren won in Germany while Felipe looked set for victory in Hungary after a brilliant pass of Hamilton. Luck, however, was not on his side and three laps from the finish, his engine failed. Kovalainen took full advantage to deliver the only victory of his career. The Brazilian redeemed himself at Valencia, in the European GP and in Belgium at the end of a lengthy sparring match with Hamilton. Monza brought the second tumultuous round of the season. Young German driver Sebastian Vettel took a surprising pole on the Saturday in a Toro Rosso powered by a Ferrari engine. Everyone suspected it was a stroke of good luck due to the rain but in the race itself, which was also held in the wet, Sebastian proved himself genuinely talented. For the first and so far only time in history, a non-Ferrari single-seater powered by a Maranello-built engine took victory. It was a fairly colourless showing from Massa and Hamilton, who were now vying virtually neck-and-neck for the title with the Brazilian just a point behind the Englishman."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"3446fbce-ea9f-4ed2-a57c-b438f585f3fe"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Singapore brought a serious setback for Felipe. The Brazilian pitted while the Safety Car was out after Nelsinho Piquet’s accident (which later proved deliberate). Unfortunately, he pulled off from the pit box with the fuel hose still attached to his F2008. It was the end of the race for the Brazilian who was leading at the time. In the last round of the season at Interlagos, Felipe was chasing Hamilton who was seven points ahead. This was the same points gap Räikkönen had made up the previous year but it seemed unlikely the miracle would repeat itself two seasons in a row. The Constructors’ Championship situation was less worrying as Ferrari held an 11-point lead on McLaren. At the start, the track was wet but beginning to dry off. Massa took the lead. Behind him things were getting complicated for Hamilton who ended up off the track after an attempted pass and dropped back to seventh. If Felipe won, Lewis would need to finish at least fifth. On lap 43, he made his way up to where he needed to be and Massa’s work seemed for nothing. However, late in the race, it started to rain once again, mixing up the positions. All the cars pitted aside from the two Toyotas that took the gamble of staying out on dry tyres. Three laps from the finish, Massa was leading and Hamilton lying only sixth. Felipe shot under the chequered flag to a huge roar from the Sao Paolo home crowd and, for a few short moments, was technically World Champion. Hamilton, however, had not given up and, helped by the rain, was upping the ante out on the track, In fact, he passed the Toyota of Timo Glock at the last corner on the final lap, to win the title by a single point.

The 458 Italia also benefits from Ferrari’s experience in Formula 1 from which it adopts precision and immediacy in response to the driver’s commands. Also, the instrument panel was developed on the basis of input from the single-seater, for the first time giving the driver a series of parameters to help optimise performance. Seven-time Formula 1 world champion, Michael Schumacher, also contributed to the design of this car. Designed by Pininfarina, it has an aerodynamic efficiency that optimises downforce and cuts drag by reducing the air intake front section of the radiator. The 4.5 litre engine is Maranello’s first centrally mounted V8 fuel injection engine. It is capable of 570 horsepower and is assisted by an F1 dual-clutch gearbox with seven gears. The 458 Italia accelerates from 0-100 km/h in under 3.4 seconds and has a top speed of 325 km/h, delivering outstanding performance combined with perfect safety thanks to the E-Diff and F1-Trac electronic systems alongside the newly developed ABS. The 458 Italia was the star of the Frankfurt Motor Show from its very first day and over the following years won a record number of awards among which the Car of the Year by Robb Report, the BBC Top Gear Car of the Year and Supercar of the Year and a similar recognition from the German magazine Auto Motor und Sport. The engine also won awards as “Best Performance Engine” and “Best Engine Above 4-litre” in 2011, 2012 and 2014 as part of the International Engine of the Year. The 458 of course has also triumphed on track: four versions have been produced. The GT2, then GTE, for the main Endurance competitions, the GT3 for all other GT championships and the Grand-Am version for races on American soil.

The kind of challenges that the most uncompromising and discerning drivers could set it, drivers who demand their cars give their all. That is why it didn’t pass unnoticed, and was talked about even before its presentation at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. But anyone who, at least initially, looked at this new model with distrust bordering on incredulity, was soon compelled to change their mind. To anyone who argued that Enzo Ferrari would not have approved of the FF, his son, Piero Ferrari, left no room for doubt: “My father would have adored this car, because it is innovative, revolutionary and is a true four-seater, like the Ferraris he used on a daily basis.” This clear opinion, with no room for doubt, best describes the first four-wheel drive Ferrari that combined extreme performance with the usability of a genuine GT with a highly innovative design. Innovation was clear in every aspect of the car, beginning with the engine, the first direct-injection V12 coupled with an F1 dual-clutch gearbox with seven gears. It has an output of 660 hp, with an extreme sports performance, evident by the top speed of 335 km/h. It was the most exclusive GT on the market, the ultimate expression of the “extreme grand tourer”, the most powerful 4-seater in the world.

This intensive work has yielded excellent results, as shown in the record aerodynamic values of the F12 Berlinetta, with its 123 kilos of downforce at 200 km/h, and DC of 0.299. These results were also obtained through the introduction of a highly innovative solution, the Aero Bridge, which –for the first time – uses the bonnet to generate downforce, diverting the flow from the top of the car to the flanks. Aerodynamic efficiency was optimised by the use of the Active Brake Cooling system of guide vanes. Situated on the brake air ducts, they open when the temperature requires it.

The LaFerrari’s futuristic aerodynamics are the result of integrated work from the initial planning of the vehicle, involving the Ferrari Styling Centre team and the design and development engineers. This engineering synergy has integrated the active aerodynamics and the hybrid system with the car’s other dynamic control systems to ensure record-breaking performance in all conditions. Indeed, integration with the car controls and dynamic parameters ensures that the active aerodynamics continually adjust to refine downforce and balance through front and rear devices. In this way the LaFerrari combines maximum downforce and minimum drag coefficient in all driving conditions to produce the fastest road car in Maranello’s history. Form married with function. Technology transfer from Formula 1 to production models is one of the historic prerogatives of the Prancing Horse. The LaFerrari is the ultimate synthesis of the know-how gained in Formula 1 and in the creation of road cars, in Maranello’s most ambitious attempt to redefine the limits of automotive technology. With the HY-KERS system it is the most powerful and efficient Ferrari ever. The application of the KERS system, tested on the racetrack and evolved specifically for use on a road car, ensures perfect integration between the V12 and the electric motor, seamlessly combining the advantages of the two propulsion systems.The design and construction of the chassis was an area of close almost symbiotic collaboration in terms of technology transfer between Formula 1 and road cars. A team of the Scuderia and GT- Technical Department engineers and technicians worked from the early stages of the project with input from Rory Byrne, designer of Prancing Horse single-seaters from 1990 to 2000, yielding 11 world titles in Formula1. The chassis is made entirely in-house at Maranello, with the same materials, facilities and production processes used by the Scuderia. Just like in Formula 1, it employs aeronautically derived “pre-preg” compounds: using four composites because each area is designed to meet specific functional requirements. The driving position is also directly derived from F1: with a fixed seat and adjustable steering column and pedals, providing a perfect setup for each driver. The thin red line of Ferrari tradition turns into a strip of asphalt in front of the driver, on which they can enjoy yet another of Maranello’s jewels.\n"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d08e5bb139a340ac582a42f","portraitMedium":""}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"2013 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["f138","458-speciale","laferrari"]},"slug":"extreme-innovation","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-18T13:24:16.432Z","id":"5d08e5f82142b5387b1b73c7","original":"5d08e5f82142b5387b1b73c7","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-18T13:24:08.172Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:19:46.608Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"THE ULTIMATE: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"2014 - THE ULTIMATE","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots"},{"name":"description","content":"Ferrari FXX K, a laboratory car based on Maranello’s first hybrid, the LaFerrari, which would be used as part of the new research and development programme.

The rear of the car is striking too: the tail is higher and the chord of the spoiler had been extended. A vertical fin and a small wing were also added each side of the tail. These act as guide vanes in the low drag configuration, while in high downforce configuration, they function as endplates to boost the efficiency of the spoiler. The Ferrari FXX K made its track debut in the hands of the Client-Test Drivers in two test days at Imola on June 4 and 5 2015.

Indeed, this car had to provide the same performance as the LaFerrari, but without the roof. Whatismore, the LaFerrari Aperta needed to provide the same handling and the same monstrous performance as the coupé version: 0-100 km/h in less than 3 seconds, a maximum speed of over 350 km/h. In addition, the customer had to be able to drive the car undisturbed by the aerodynamic flows even at 300 km/h. For this reason, in the months prior to its presentation at the Paris Motor Show, the heads of the chassis and aerodynamics department worked hard with the Styling Centre to achieve all of the car’s dynamic and load objectives, without sacrificing the iconic design of the LaFerrari. It is easy to see why work was needed on the chassis: without a roof, it was necessary to share the load lines in the lower part of the body. The end result is a negligible increase in weight, while preserving the torsional and flexural rigidity of the LaFerrari. As with every self-respecting Ferrari roadster, cockpit turbulence is reduced to a minimum. This is possible due to the design of an integrated system, capable of “capturing” the high-speed flow that tends to enter the compartment. The occupants are thus enveloped in quiet up to a top speed of 150 km/h. Although it is an easy bet that the desire to be carried away by the unique excitement of open-air driving, accompanied by the overpowering soundtrack of the first Ferrari hybrid power unit, is likely to gain the upper hand much sooner.\n\n"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"041ae52a-ff4f-4cec-9000-d790f25b9eb3"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"Moreover, the V12 that boasts a maximum output of 800 hp, with the addition of a 120 kW electric motor for a total output of 963 hp, is an exceptional performer that no one can resist.

This sparked an intense head-to-head battle with Lewis Hamilton that saw the Ferrari driver roar to the top of the world rankings as the summer break arrived. But in the same period, the company was also reeling from the shock of the unexpected, all-too-early death of its Chairman and CEO Sergio Marchionne. \nMarchionne left a huge legacy which was embraced with fearlessness by new President John Elkann and the new CEO Louis Camilleri who had the task of presenting the new industrial plan that Italian-Canadian executive had worked so hard on. Shareholders were invited to the new Style Centre which was officially opened especially for the occasion, to listen to the two men sharing that vision of the company’s short-term future. Fifteen new cars in three years, a powerful focus on the future through major investment in R\u0026D, and a response to climate change-related problems in the form of a range of which 60% will be hybrid models. \nThat determined focus on tomorrow does not meaning reneging on the extraordinary wealth of creativity and solutions from the past. Rather it reinterprets and lends them new and unique technological and stylistic slants. An approach brilliantly epitomised by the first two products of the Icona project, the Monza SP1 and the Monza SP2, which were unveiled on Capital Market Day. The two cars, a single-seater and a two-seater respectively, both sport the most powerful naturally-aspirated V12 ever built by Ferrari, that of the 812 Superfast. They are the product of a concept that uses some of the most evocative cars from Ferrari history as the leitmotif for a whole new segment of limited edition special series models developed specifically with Ferrari clients and collectors in mind. Cars inspired by the barchette of the 1950s which were driven to victory in the international championships not just by the Scuderia Ferrari’s works drivers but also by gentlemen drivers who often raced against the legendary big names of the day. \n"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d09eae79d16620aaf2780f4","portraitMedium":"5d09eae79d16620aaf2780f4"}},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"The new models officially debuted at the Paris International Motor Show where the Prancing Horse also took the wraps off the Ferrari 488 Pista Spider, which had received its world premiere at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance.

It is an explosively innovative car whose refined, timeless beauty meant it became an instant contemporary design icon on its launch.

The Ferrari V12 spider story brims with legendary models, starting with the 166 MM from 1948 and running all the way up to the aforementioned 365 GTS4, also known as the “Daytona Spider”. The 812 GTS set a new benchmark in terms of both performance and exclusivity. Its majestic 800 cv Ferrari V12 engine makes it the most powerful spider on the market. It is also the most usable, thanks to its unique retractable hard top, which frees up extra luggage room. Two new gems were also added to the 8-cylinder range: the F8 Tributo and the F8 Spider. As its name suggests, the Tributo is the pinnacle of Ferrari achievement in this category as well as paying homage to the most powerful V8 ever built by Ferrari. The two mid-rear-engined two-seater F8s have very different characters crafted around the same 720 cv engine.

This is the first 6-cylinder ever used in a road car sporting the Prancing Horse badge: its massive 830 cv combined output delivers both unparalleled performance and exhilaratingly innovative soundtrack unique of its kind."},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"629e0a15da1ea90d28af3ce8-2021-ferrari-history-focus-3","portraitMedium":"629e0a15da1ea90d28af3ce8-2021-ferrari-history-focus-3"}},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"There were revolutions large and small on the communications and brand front too. After the launch of its new Corporate Identity, Ferrari made a stylish debut in the fashion world with its first ever fashion collection designed by creative director Rocco Iannone. The catwalk show took place between the productions lines where the Prancing Horse models are built. The collection is right at home in its natural habitat: the new Ferrari Stores which were completely redesigned as part of a project that also involved the successful renovation of the historic Ristorante “Cavallino”, now in the talented hands of chef  Massimo Bottura. Big names, just like Flavio Manzoni head of the design team that crafted the timeless lines of the latest addition to the Icona special series, the Daytona SP3,  inspired by one of the iconic cars in Ferrari history, the 330 P4. A masterpiece unveiled at the Finali Mondiali Ferrari at Mugello in November, providing yet another opportunity to celebrate the Prancing Horse’s success story on and off the

That win would be the first milestone in the genuinely unparalleled sporting career of a team that has clocked up more Formula 1 victories than any other. That first win had its roots in mid-1945 when Enzo Ferrari commissioned Gioachino Colombo to design a completely innovative car for him. Ferrari’s ambition was, of course, to beat the Alfa Romeos which he knew intimately as he had spent so much time with the Milan team, first as a driver, then as sporting director, racking up triumph after triumph in the pre-War years. As far as Enzo Ferrari was concerned the engine was the heart of any car. Hence his incredible focus on the power unit from that first design onwards. The choice fell on a 12-cylinder architecture, which would have the power to deliver the kind of performance required. The engine moniker, 125, referenced its unit displacement: 125 multiplied by 12 gives the overall displacement of the engine, a mere 1,500cc."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"400eb31a-abc4-4cf3-b122-7d9ba0c38277"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"The months flew by as work ploughed ahead on building the engine with Gioachino Colombo handing over the design reins to Giuseppe Busso.

Two months later, on May 11 1947, the 125 S made its racing debut at the Piacenza Circuit. The S in its name stood for Sport, referring to its open sports car body style. At its wheel was Franco Cortese. Two cars were actually entered in the race – the second was a 125 C which, although identical in terms of its running gear had a narrow single-seater body (hence the C for ‘competition’).

It was the first of its kind and Enzo Ferrari was well aware of that fact.   \nThe versatile sports prototypes had proved themselves capable of winning on circuits of all kinds – permanent, city, dirt track. They were now, however, ready to step into the limelight at other prestige international events. Concours d’Elegance, for instance, were starting to gain popularity, becoming an important avenue both for meeting new clients and selling cars customised to suit each owners’ tastes and requirements. Many of the customers were privateer drivers who bought the 166 MM in its racing set-up to field in various competitions. Others, however, were simply well-heeled drivers who opted for the road-going version, often happily also specifying various modifications to the exterior and the cabin. Ferrari wanted to apply the same approach to other international motor shows, and was eager to launch the car at what was one of the world’s most important events - Turin was also home to various car marques and coachworks. For the 166 MM Touring Superleggera’s body, Ferrari turned to the Milanese coachworks that had invented the eponymous Superleggera construction system, which had already proved its worth in the aeronautics industry. The patented method involved fixing aluminum alloy panels directly to a small-diameter steel tubular spaceframe. As a result, the chassis and bodywork formed a single, homogenous unit, providing good structural rigidity and anticipating the weight-bearing chassis concept that would be introduced years later. The 166 MM’s clean, simple forms also proved exceptionally aerodynamically efficient. It had a very low dry weight of just 650 kg too, but its V12 engine unleashed 140 bhp and its fuel tank held 90-litres. \nJust 25 Touring Superleggera-bodied 166 MMs were built. One was purchased by Giovanni Agnelli and was his first Ferrari.

Chinetti was Italian-born but lived in America. He’d originally gone to the States in May 1940 to race at Indianapolis, but within a few days of his arrival Italy entered the War. In the end, Chinetti made the wise decision to stay in the US and take up American citizenship.

This result, and those achieved in the other races by the crews with the new 4,500 cc 375 MM helped Ferrari win the first World Sportscar Championship in 1953. The story of Matzotto and Ferrari started in 1948, when the driver met Enzo Ferrari at the factory to buy a 166 Inter Touring 2-litre. At that time a car could be customised from scratch, so Marzotto went to Maranello to do precisely that. The Marzotto family were excellent Ferrari customers, and Gianni, when racing with the Lancia Aprilia, demonstrated his speed. There he developed a frank relationship marked by mutual respect, although with no shortage of disagreements. To understand what sort of driver Marzotto was, suffice it to say that he used to change gears without the clutch, by ear, listening to the rising rev count. In October 1949 Ferrari tested him in the Vermicino-Rocca di Papa time trial, which Marzotto won. The following year, four members of the Marzotto family started the Mille Miglia with four Ferraris paid in cash – two 195 S models entered by Scuderia Ferrari for Giannino and his brother Vittorio, and two 166 MMs of Scuderia Marzotto for Paolo and Umberto."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"530d209e-bf4a-4a91-913b-8ec45ae79f32"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"The fans’ eyes were on the official cars of the more famous Alberto Ascari and Luigi Villoresi, but at the end of a rain-soaked edition with 375 starters, Giannino Marzotto and Marco Crosara won in the 195 S Berlinetta Touring.

Included in the haul were six examples of the D50 single-seater. The D50 had proved extremely promising, but Lancia had never managed to fully exploit its potential. However, once in the hands of the Scuderia Ferrari, the car began to deliver on its promise. At the first Grand Prix of the season in Buenos Aires, the Prancing Horse team fielded four D50s entrusted to Fangio, Luigi Musso, Eugenio Castellotti and Olivier Gendebien, while young Peter Collins was still in the 4-cylinder 555.

As foreseen, Collins was forced to retire while von Trips escorted Taruffi to the finish line, telling the press that he had tried to attack him in the previous stretches but had failed. The German was only 29 years old and, out of respect, had no problem in accepting team orders that always favoured the veterans.

As always, the endurance season started in America, with two Florida classics, in Daytona and Sebring. The latter, with the traditional 12-hour race, was the first round of the World Sportscar Championship. The Sebring circuit is totally unique. It occupies a part of Hendricks Field airport, which during the Second World War was a training centre for B-17 ‘Flying Fortress’ bomber pilots. The main feature of the track is still the same today – stretches of concrete, which put the cars under considerable stress. This is why people often say that, in terms of wear, the 12 Hours of Sebring is equivalent to the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In fact, many teams have used the American race to develop prototypes for the Circuit de la Sarthe classic. In late 1959 Sebring also hosted the first edition of the United States Grand Prix, in which Tony Brooks finished third, and, unfortunately lost the World Championship by a few points, the Scuderia having missed the British Grand Prix due to a strike."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"02ba806d-3048-4223-9c9b-10b9a117625f"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Ferrari was favourite in the 12 Hours of Sebring with four official cars on the track – three 250 Testa Rossa models and, for the first time, a 250 GT California Spider, joined by several other specimens entered by private teams and NART of Luigi Chinetti.

It seemed the deal was done but it fell through due to a misunderstanding. Ferrari and Moss tried again 10 years later, at the end of 1961, when an agreement was reached to supply the Rob Walker team with a Formula 1 car and the British Racing Partnership (BRP) – the team of Alfred Moss, Stirling’s father – with a 250 GTO. When everything was ready, Moss was out of action, the victim of a terrible accident in a Lotus at Goodwood, which put an end to his career. That marriage could have changed the history of F1 and have delivered Moss the world title he never won, having only ever taken four second places. Nevertheless, Moss raced 15 times with Prancing Horse cars, winning 12; following the two victories in the Tourist Trophy with the 250 GT Berlinetta of Rob Walker in 1960 and 1961, everything was set for the agreement that unfortunately bore no fruit. The first time Moss raced a Ferrari was in 1957, in the Bahamas, when the Briton won two races in the Nassau Trophy at the wheel of a 290 MM belonging to the Temple Buell team. Then he triumphed in Cuba in 1958 with a 335 S entered by Luigi Chinetti.

At the start of the Tourist Trophy in 1962 he was replaced by Innes Ireland, who triumphed! It was a memorable edition, with an all-Ferrari podium: behind the 250 GTO of Ireland came the cars driven by Graham Hill and Mike Parkes who, in that order, went on to dominate the 1963 edition.Hill won again the following year this time at the wheel of the 330 P, ahead of David Piper, who was competing for his own team in a Ferrari 250 LM.

Before this, however, Ferrari went through something of an inner struggle. Enzo had to change his mind and agree to put ‘the cart before the horse’ by launching a single-seater and sports car with the engine behind the driver. The decision paid off extraordinarily, with three world titles in one go: Drivers’ and Constructors’ in F1, plus the World Sportscar Championship. Of course, not everything went right as with the tragic death of Ferrari driver Wolfgang von Trips. In addition, that triumphant season ended in a storm, with the team acquiring a totally new management and technical leadership. The 156 F1 designed by Carlo Chiti astonished everyone because it was the first Ferrari mid-engine single-seater. It was dubbed ‘the shark’, due to its innovatively shaped nose with two angled vents that made it look like the great predator. This car helped Phil Hill to win the Drivers’ title by one point over the unfortunate Von Trips, who lost his life in Monza, together with 15 fans. The other Ferrari driver, Richie Ginther, was fifth in the final rankings. Phil Hill set a new Nürburgring record in qualifying, lapping in less than nine minutes, and was also the first American driver to win the F1 World Championship."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"48935775-d6a4-4f34-9795-2b762ba36388"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"The young Giancarlo Baghetti also had a day of glory in the 156, winning on his F1 debut at Reims, with a Scuderia Sant’Ambroeus vehicle hired from the Italian federation.

Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien came first. The Belgian driver – this time paired with Von Trips – repeated the feat soon after at the Targa Florio, behind the wheel of the 246 SP. While the Nürburgring 1000 Kilometres just yielded placings (from 2nd to 5th), the 24 Hours of Le Mans brought another great hat-trick, Hill and Gendebien won again. However, the Italians Lorenzo Bandini and Giorgio Scarlatti won the last World Championship race, the Pescara Grand Prix.

The 250 GTO delivered three world championships to Maranello from 1962 to 1964, plus many victories in the most prestigious races.

Le Mans was a Maranello fiefdom from 1960, with the three consecutive wins by the specialist Olivier Gendebien: one paired with Paul Frère in an all-Belgian crew, and two with Phil Hill, but actually the duo had previously won in 1958. So 1964 was the fourth consecutive victory for the Prancing Horse; another couple came over the following years. The P 250 was a car from which much was expected, since it was the first with a 3-litre 310 hp mid-engined 12-cylinder power unit. It was designed by Pininfarina, now written as one word, after a decree in 1961 by President of Italy Giovanni Gronchi allowing the change of surname. The car stood out for the rollbar/wing behind the driver’s head and the two air intakes on the rear wheel arches, accompanying a very clean and effective line. In 1963 it won three races out of four and took the World Endurance title.\n\n"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d05580110a7220b561f9297","portraitMedium":"5d0557c312e3b50c1510abf8"}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"1963 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["250-p","330-p","250-lm","156-f1-63"]},"slug":"le-mans-italy","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-15T20:43:38.129Z","id":"5d0558763ad9250aee5324ac","original":"5d0558763ad9250aee5324ac","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-15T20:43:34.382Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:19:53.708Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"HERO OF THE TWO WORLDS: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"1964 - HERO OF THE TWO WORLDS","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots","content":"index-follow"},{"name":"description","content":"The year 1964 was historic for the racing world: “Big John” succeeded in his quest to become the Formula 1 World Champion.

Then along came racing, a passion that had devoured him since boyhood, never flourishing fully due to his choice of career. A shame, as he clearly has the potential to establish himself as a champion, and triumph in a lot more than the 19 international races that he actually won. Enzo Ferrari considered him an ideal driver for the sports-protoypes, and was proved right – with Jean Guichet, Vaccarella won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1964 behind the wheel of the 275 P, helping the Maranello Scuderia to win the World Sports Car Championship. Such was his dedication to his school, however, that Vaccarella skipped the celebrations following his victory at Le Mans, choosing instead to go to work on the Monday morning after the race. In the magical year of 1964, Vaccarella also came second at Sebring (as he did in ’63), and took first place in the 1000 km of the Nürburgring and in the Coppa Intereuropa at Monza. Then in 1965, he sped to victory with a Ferrari on home turf in the Targa Florio, 72 km over difficult and gruelling roads through the Madonie mountains. In this edition of the race, he drove alongside Lorenzo Bandini, taking an all-Italian victory ahead of a host of Porsche and Ford works cars present. They set a new record for the circuit, completing the ten laps (a distance of 720 km in total) in 7 hours 1 minute and 12 seconds, in front of around 250,000 spectators"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"8489101a-852e-4fcf-9e34-190c1ad2e8ad"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Vaccarella was 32, while Bandini was just 30. Together, they represented the youth of Italy, driving fast and making their mark in the international arena. It became apparent that Ferrari had a soft spot for young Italians, treating them like sons, taking them on in dribs and drabs so as not to place them in direct competition with one another. The team tried to launch their careers without burning them out or losing them, so they gave them each a turn, one by one. In 1965, Ferrari earmarked the F1 Italian Grand Prix for Vaccarella, where he raced in a 158 F1, remaining in sixth place until he was forced to withdraw due to engine failure. Regardless of this, 1964 and 1965 were enchanted years for the Sicilian driver. His companion Bandini, fresh from taking 4th place in the F1 World Championship, also won at Le Mans, as well as twice taking second place in the Targa Florio. From this result, it seems that his heart was truly set on winning the Sicilian marathon. With Vaccarella, he finally succeeded.\nTheir car for the Targa Florio was one the models from the all-conquering P series, developed over four years from 1964 onwards; the 275 P2 was the first evolution of this range and came out in 1965 alongside the 330 P2, which featured a larger engine."},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d05fae93ad9250aee5324b7","portraitMedium":"5d05faff107b060e8f527a60"}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"1965 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["330-p2","275-p2","dino-166p","dino-206-sp"]},"slug":"victory-at-targa","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-16T08:19:13.412Z","id":"5d05fb7c12e3b50c1510ac04","original":"5d05fb7c12e3b50c1510ac04","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-16T08:19:08.966Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:20:04.274Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"365 P JEWEL: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"1966 - 365 P JEWEL","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots","content":"index-follow"},{"name":"description","content":"Ferrari 365 P Berlinetta Speciale: the car was presented at the 1966 Paris Motor Show, in White Gardenia.

It was so beautiful that Gianni Agnelli fell in love with it and commissioned a second copy, which was delivered the following year in Turin, in metallic grey and with a rear spoiler. At first glance it’s the shape that attracts, with its slender long, clean lines, with sloping struts on the tail. Although it was a longer car, it was a precursor for the lines seen on future Dino models. Exterior details included a glass sunroof that was cutting edge for the time, a visible petrol cap, air vents in front of the rear wheel arches, and a dual exhaust. However, the most notable feature was concealed in the passenger compartment: this car was a three-seater, with the driver’s seat in the centre. This unique feature was rare for its time, but was then picked up by a couple of other manufacturers a few years later. That’s not all though. For the first time, a Ferrari GT used a mid-engine architecture, in this case using the race-derived 4.4-litre V12. In fact, the mechanics were taken largely from the racing Ferrari 365 P2. US importer, Luigi Chinetti, bought the white model, selling it and buying it back twice. It was auctioned in 2014 with 7900 km on the clock, but an offer of nearly USD 23 million was rejected! Gianni Agnelli kept his version for a few years, before selling it in the US. One of the two cars was repainted, first in metallic blue and then red, but the original colours of the two specimens are white and metallic grey. Gianni Agnelli said of the car: “You didn’t have time to stop before people were immediately around it. But it was fun. It had monstrous acceleration. You just had to get used to the driver’s seat in the middle, because it gave an ideal any reference points to either side, right or left.”"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d05ffe810a7220b561f929c","portraitMedium":"5d05ffe810a7220b561f929c"}},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"1966 Masterpieces","portraitMedium":""}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"1966 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["dino-206-s","330-p3","365-california","330-gts"]},"slug":"365-p-jewel","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-16T08:40:04.963Z","id":"5d060060107b060e8f527a62","original":"5d060060107b060e8f527a62","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-16T08:40:00.494Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:20:07.185Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"LEGENDARY FINISH: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"1967 - LEGENDARY FINISH","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots","content":"index-follow"},{"name":"description","content":"1967: Three Ferraris – two 330 P4s and a 412 P – take the first three places in the 24 Hours of Daytona.

However, in 1966, it was the turn of the more powerful Fords. The two headed to Daytona in early 1967 for the first round of the International Constructors’ Championship (as the World Sport Championship was renamed for two years), with two separate classifications for GTs and prototypes. In order to close the gap on Ford, Ferrari spent the winter of 1966 working hard in Maranello. The new 330 P4 was designed by Mauro Forghieri, with a number of P3 models being updated too, becoming 330 P3/ P4s. The abbreviation 412 P identified the customer version of the latter vehicle. Intended for use by private teams, it lacked a number of strategic components such as the injection system, which was replaced by normal carburettors. The 330 P4 boasted sophisticated aerodynamics, developed in the wind tunnels at Pininfarina and at the Polytechnic in Stuttgart, Germany, the city where both Mercedes and Porsche are based. The P4 had a lower Cd than its predecessors, with greater downforce and a very low nose section. The 4-litre, 450 hp V12 engine featured double overhead camshafts and 3 valves per cylinder. The gearbox, made by Ferrari, was also new, along with the car’s suspension system. In addition, in order to prepare for the competition, and despite the high cost of the entire trip, Scuderia Ferrari decide to travel to Daytona in December 1966, for a test day on the track. The results were very promising. Enzo Ferrari nominated journalist Franco Lini as his sporting director – as well as being competent and agreeable, Lini was also an expert in international regulations. During the race, everything went well. Ferrari dominated, and then Lini has a stroke of genius: he asked the Ferrari drivers, who were in the first three places in the race, to stage a side-by-side parade finish along the banking. The finish was immortalised by the American press agencies, and made its way around the world, becoming one of the most famous photos ever in automotive history. The triumphant finish graced the front pages of every major newspaper in the world, and marked Ferrari’s revenge over its rivals. Curiously, Chris Amon was in the winning team both at Le Mans in 1966 with Ford and at Daytona in ’67 with Ferrari, but he never succeeded in taking home an F1 victory."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"4252c319-c379-46fa-9e65-49bbe99ce7c6"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"In summary, the end result saw the 330 P3/P4 (P3 chassis and P4 engine) spider driven by Bandini/Amon come first, followed by the 330 P4 coupé driven by Parkes-Scarfiotti and the 412 P from Luigi Chinetti’s NART team in third, driven by Rodriguez-Guichet.

Pininfarina had been aware of this for some time, and thanks to Leonardo Fioravanti’s skilful pencil, there were already drawings ready. The new car was wedge shaped and very slender, with great attention paid to aerodynamics, and a truncated tail. Sergio Pininfarina liked the design, and later altered the final shape of the car, streamlining the nose even further, which initially had a large Plexiglas strip that integrated the headlights. This feature would be eliminated in 1971, with the adoption of retractable headlights. Ferrari approved the project, and in 1967, began the construction of the first prototype. In 1968, the car was ready for the limelight. From a technical perspective, the engineering team in Maranello maintained the classic chassis construction with a tubular spaceframe with oval-section tubes. The front and rear track were wider to accommodate the additional performance available from the 320-hp 4.4-litre dual overhead camshaft V12. The 365 refers to the displacement per cylinder, the 4 to the camshafts, while B stands for berlinetta: this is the origin of the name 365 GTB4. At the time, the Paris Motor Show was considered to be the leading event of its kind, the most important of all, perhaps due to the charm of the City of Light, but the fact remains that all the exciting new models made their catwalk debut there. The Daytona could reach speeds of more than 280 km/h, with outstanding acceleration, and was relatively easy to drive, keeping in mind that it was still a GT. It was the most high-performance car of the period. Like any self-respecting Ferrari, it proved fast on the track too, and won its category at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1972, ’73, and ’74, and took second place at Daytona in 1979: an amazing testament to the longevity of the design, especially given that in the meantime production of the car had ceased. As usual, Luigi Chinetti requested a spider version for the American market, and for California in particular. The 365 GTS4 was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1969.\n\n"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d060fb212e3b50c1510ac0a","portraitMedium":""}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"1968 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["612-can-am","dino-246-tasmania","312-f1-68"]},"slug":"tribute-to-the-triumph","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-16T09:50:18.941Z","id":"5d0610c73ad9250aee5324bb","original":"5d0610c73ad9250aee5324bb","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-16T09:49:59.831Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:19:53.709Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"ARGENTINE TANGO: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"1968 - ARGENTINE TANGO","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots","content":"index-follow"},{"name":"description","content":"1968: De Adamich wins Temporada with Ferrari Dino 166 F2.

The Temporada was founded when the Automobile Club of Argentina (ACC) invited European drivers to compete in a championship, held not only in Argentina but also Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. The ACA also bought cars for young local racing talent. The first of these “migrations” to the south took place at the end of the 1947 season, a time when Argentina was ruled by General Juan Domingo Peron – a racing enthusiast and generous funder. Scuderia Ferrari participated for the first time in 1948. Over the years, in line with the political toing and froing, the Temporada was suspended, only to be reborn thanks to Juan Manuel Fangio and, almost 20 years later in 1968, thanks to the national oil company. The Temporada was based on four races for Formula 2 cars, and Scuderia Ferrari competed with two Dino 166s, driven by Ernesto “Tino” Brambilla and Andrea De Adamich. The starting line-up included 25 top-level drivers, some whom had already raced in Formula 1, including Jochen Rindt, Clay Regazzoni, Jean-Pierre Beltoise, Jo Siffert, Silvio Moser, and Pedro Rodriguez, driving for teams including Techno, Matra, Brabham, and Lotus. The Dino 166 F2 had already appeared in 1967 and competed in just a single race, with Jonathan Williams in Rouen. It was developed thanks to an agreement with Fiat to produce 500 engines for the Dino road car which carried the Fiat and Ferrari marque.

He became CEO in 1963, and Chairman three years later. Agnelli was a great admirer of Ferrari cars, and indeed, became a customer of the brand. His first Ferrari was a 166 MM Touring Superleggera, from 1948; later his others included the 365 P and the Testarossa Spider. Over the years, Enzo Ferrari was aware that he could no longer bear the financial burden of the marque’s sporting activity alone, and in 1963, came close to selling to Ford. The tough negotiations lasted throughout April and May, but just before he signed, Enzo backed out, preserving the autonomy of the brand’s racing division. The desire to find a strong ally, however, remained paramount, and in 1965, Ferrari reached an agreement with Fiat to produce the 6-cylinder Dino engine, designed by Ferrari and developed at the factories of the Turin-based company, to be fitted on the new Fiat Dino, spider and coupé. Soon after came the Dino Ferrari, made in Maranello. Ferrari was required to receive type-approval for the Ferrari Dino 166 for F2, and to do this, the company built more than 500 production models, with the engine designed during this period by Enzo’s son. From then on, the conversations between Ferrari and Agnelli regarding a possible takeover became increasingly frequent.

With streamlined, low and extremely aggressive lines, it was the first production Ferrari to be fitted with the boxer-type 12-cylinder engine derived from the F1 unit. The technical approach taken was completely different from that adopted on all other Ferrari models produced so far, and the architecture was not that of the classic front-engined V12s – the longitudinally-mounted engine featured opposing cylinder banks. The two Bs stand for Berlinetta Boxer. This name was derived from the fact that the cylinder banks form an angle of 180°, producing an engine with a flat, rectangular shape which enabled the car’s centre of gravity to be lowered. From a technical standpoint, this solution rendered design and construction more complex. Precisely for this reason, the gestation period for this model took longer than usual.

The contrast gave the car a super sporty, modern look, pre-empting a trend that is still in vogue today. The satin black finish for the lower part of the car became an option on the entire range built in Maranello, and was referred to as the “Boxer” paint finish. The curved line which marked the boundary of the passenger compartment, behind the seats, created the optical illusion of a small door. A matte black spoiler was mounted at the end of the car’s roof.

That was largely due to the installation of the F1 derived 3,000 cc, 460 hp 12-cylinder Boxer. Therefore, 1971 was a year of development, with a promising one-two in the 9 hours of Kyalami that boded well for the coming year, with Clay Regazzoni and Brian Redman finished ahead of Mario Andretti and Jacky Ickx. In the 1972, season Ferrari registered three cars with fast and highly experienced drivers. In addition to the four who competed in Kyalami, Ronnie Peterson, Tim Schenken and Arturo Merzario made regular appearances. Rally champions Sandro Munari, Helmut Marko and Carlos Pace also competed in some races. The programme’s sports director was former driver Peter Schetty, winner of the European Mountain Championship in 1969, who did not hesitate to change the make up of the crews in order to defeat the Alfa Romeos, Porsches and Matras. Indeed, Ferrari’s domination turned out to be overwhelming, with 10 wins out of 10 races. Two Ferraris were on the podium in every race: including eight one-twos, plus a victory and third place at Monza. The highlight came at Zeltweg, when the four Ferraris took the top four positions. Maranello won the 1972 Championship for Makes, with Andretti and Ickx leading the way with four wins, while the Belgian driver won another two with Regazzoni and Redman. The latter won twice, the second time with Merzario, who also finished first with Munari in the Targa Florio. The victory in Sicily was a stroke of genius. Ferrari had the great idea of deploying the rally champion out of his natural environment, and the driver – although not as fast as Merzario – showed his mettle with sports cars; both on the road in Sicily and in the 1000km of Zeltweg.

Moreover, it was styled by Bertone, not Pininfarina, for the first time since 1953.","excerpt":"","audioId":"ccd1b790-8a5f-4dde-b9de-1a11e2bd3a69","background":{"landscapeBig":"5d064bc010a7220b561f92a7","portraitMedium":"5d064bf412e3b50c1510ac17"},"backgroundMobile":{"landscapeMedium":"5d064bc010a7220b561f92a7","portraitMedium":"5d064bf412e3b50c1510ac17"},"blocks":[{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d064c0910a7220b561f92a8","portraitMedium":"5d064c0910a7220b561f92a8"}},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"But there was a reason for this. It was designed by Marcello Gandini who, working for the Turin body shop, created many of the most popular sports cars of the era, for several marques. His masterpieces were typically sharp and slender shaped, very futuristic and with strong personalities. Ferrari was impressed by this approach to sports car design, and decided to use the Dino logo to diversify. Bertone also designed the Fiat Dino coupé, while Pininfarina designed the Spider. The car was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show and just carried the Dino badge, as was then customary for Maranello cars not equipped with a V12 engine. The 308 GT4 completed the range, which already included the 246 GT and GTS, until they went out of production. The digits in the name referred to the engine’s cubic capacity and to the number of cylinders, in this case three litres and eight respectively, while the four signified that it was a four-seater. The car had two rear seats even though it was only 4.3 metres long. Compact with a powerful heart, it used the available space cleverly. It hosted a 2996 cc and 255 hp V8 engine at 90°, centrally mounted in front of the rear axle and with a top speed of 250 km/h. The Dino also had rear-wheel drive and a 5-speed gearbox. It was produced between 1974 and 1978.

With regard to the Technical Department, Mauro Forghieri regained full power and, with it, the freedom to propose new and innovative solutions. The team’s Team Principle was twenty-six-year-old Luca di Montezemolo, while the drivers were Clay Regazzoni, returning to Ferrari after a year spent with the BRM team, and the young Austrian, Niki Lauda, also from BRM. Indeed, it was Regazzoni who recommended Lauda to Enzo Ferrari, after witnessing him in action over the course of their shared year with BRM. According to Regazzoni, Lauda had great potential, making him preferable not only to Jean-Pierre Jarier, but also to Peter Revson and James Hunt. At any rate, Enzo Ferrari’s famed foresight and courage when it comes to choosing young talent was no less evident on this occasion. The introduction of a dedicated team of mechanics for each driver was another new development that year. Clay’s chief mechanic was Giulio Borsari, while Niki’s was Ermanno Cuoghi. The car – the 312 B3 – was a successful design: its most noticeable characteristic was the striking air intake, located directly behind the driver’s helmet, which was painted red with a white band half way up. Those colours echoed those of the flag of Niki Lauda’s home country, as well as alluding to Clay Regazzoni’s Swiss heritage… Right from the start, the 312-B3 proved highly competitive, and in its first ever race in Argentina, Lauda and Regazzoni made it onto the podium in second and third place. Regazzoni came second in Brazil, before the car’s crowning moment in Spain, at the Jarama circuit just outside Madrid. There Niki Lauda took his first Formula 1 victory, taking home a 50th win for the Scuderia Ferrari since the start of the F1 championship. Regazzoni came second, completing Ferrari’s glorious winning streak. In Jarama, Lauda reigned supreme, taking pole position and completing the fastest lap in the race. The start of the race was hit by rain, and the positions changed continually, with the wet-track specialist Ronnie Peterson taking the lead. Around halfway through, the weather changed, and a pit stop for tyre changes served to mix things up. Ferrari’s mechanics completed Lauda’s pitstop in just 35 seconds, a remarkable time for 1974."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"6d460a72-0828-430e-a0cb-313f78bebe71"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Very quickly, the Austrian successfully regained the lead, going on to win more than 35 seconds ahead of his team-mate, who started third on the grid.

The new 312 T was not ready for the start of the season, but the drivers were the same as before, and the 312-B3 was nonetheless more than capable of ensuring a sufficient degree of competitiveness. Or it least this was the general view held. In reality, in the opening races in both Argentina and Brazil, the competition succeeded in closing the gap, and the Ferrari team had to content itself with finishing in the points, with two fourth places for the moustachioed pilot from Lugano, and a fifth and a sixth place for the Austrian. This somewhat meagre outcome did not live up to expectations. The new Goodyear compounds were not suited to the old B3, so Ferrari asked his technical staff to speed up the preparation of the new car, with a view to debuting it in South Africa. In comparison to the older model, the 312 T was completely new. While it was still equipped with the boxer engine, the new car featured a transverse gearbox mounted in front of the rear wheels, as signified by the “T” in the name of the model. The goal was to move the weight balance forward as far as possible, rendering the car shorter and easier to handle. In side view, the car had a noticeable wedge shape, while the engine air intake remained prominent, albeit now finished in white with the colours of the Italian flag. New suspension all round contributed to improving the performance of the tyres, and the large overhanging rear spoiler was also completely redesigned. In South Africa, the cars were still not entirely up to standard, and lacked reliability, although Lauda came in fifth. In the test days at Kyalami after the GP, however, Lauda succeeded in lapping faster than the time set for the race’s pole position. And he then took the car’s first win at the BRDC International Trophy (a non-championship race) at Silverstone."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"98be2f43-2a72-4849-9622-c646fa01091d"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"In Spain, Lauda took the pole position, but during the race both drivers were caught up in an accident, Lauda being eliminated straight away while Regazzoni made it back to the pits for repairs, only not to classify in the race results.

Lauda showed how meticulous he could be in the fine-tuning of the car and how good he was at choosing tyres, and went on to achieve a series of superb victories that lead him to the top of the standings. He won three races in a row in Monaco, Belgium and Sweden, and took second place in Holland before coming in first again in France. Lauda then went on to take two third places in Germany and Italy, consolidating his lead in the standings and taking the World\nChampion title before the last race. The season closed with a bang in the US, with yet another victory in a nation that was strategic for Ferrari with regard to the sale of the road cars. Regazzoni also had a good season, finishing first at Monza, taking two podium placings in Germany and France, and closing the season in fifth place overall in the Drivers’rankings, thus helping to win the Constructors’ Championship for Ferrari. Lauda’s dominance was further underlined by the nine pole positions and two lap records added to his list of achievements.

Lauda took his first win of 1977 in the tragic South African Grand Prix, which was rocked by the death of Tom Pryce. The British driver was killed instantly when he was struck by a heavy fire extinguisher being carried by a marshal, as he rushed across the track to deal with a fire in Renzo Zorzi’s Shadow. Unfortunately, after the incident, Pryce’s car continued down the straight and hit the Ligier of Lafitte who was braking into the first corner. Fortunately, the French driver emerged unscathed from the collision. Mario Andretti drove the Lotus to victory at Long Beach, while Lauda racked up good points by delivering three second-place finishes in four races. In France, despite finishing a modest fifth, he took the lead in the championship and held onto it for the rest of the season. Thanks to the latest modifications, the 312 T2 was an almost-perfect car and the very determined Austrian did not put a foot wrong. Car number 11, in fact, won at Hockenheim in Germany in what felt like an exorcism of the accident at the Nürburgring 12 months previously, and then did so again in Holland. It also took secured second-place finishes in Great Britain, Austria and Italy. Thanks to Lauda’s podium position at Monza, Ferrari sealed the Constructors’ Cup with three races remaining in the season. The Italian crowd went wild, in part because the top step was occupied by a former, and still-much loved Ferrari driver, Mario Andretti, who was then with Lotus.

However, once the battle for the world title was over, Lauda and Enzo Ferrari’s very different perspectives came to the fore. The Austrian felt that much of the credit for the victory was due to his skills and asked for a substantial raise, something Ferrari would not grant.

Lauda went to Canada but refused to take part to the race weekend, declaring that the car didn’t have the potential to win at Mosport Park.

However, the British team was highly motivated because it wanted to dedicate a victory to Ronnie Peterson, who died following an accident at the Monza Grand Prix. There were many driver changes to come in 1979 – it was Carlos Reutemann’s last race for the Scuderia before he joined Lotus, while for Wolf, Jody Scheckter was on his way out. His future was at Ferrari, where he would partner Gilles Villeneuve. The Canadian stayed on despite being outclassed by Reutemann. The Argentinian fought with the Brabham of Niki Lauda for third place in the world championship, winning in Brazil, Long Beach, the UK and Watkins Glen. Villeneuve however collected just eight points, with a third in Austria, a fourth in Belgium and sixth in the Netherlands. But Enzo Ferrari believed in him and decided to give him another chance. The Ferraris led in the first sessions, held in the pouring rain, although Jean-Pierre Jarier, who had replaced Peterson at Lotus, got the better of them in qualifying. Scheckter was second, followed by Villeneuve. On race day, the track was wet and the mercury below zero. Jarier led, followed by Jones, who shot from fifth to second, then Scheckter and Villeneuve. The leading Lotus was very fast and pulled away, while Jones increasingly struggled to keep behind the Scuderia pair for 1979.

The race leader was forced to slow down noticeably earlier than usual. The Frenchman still led for a while despite the death throws of the Lotus braking system, but he was eventually forced to make a sad return to the pits. Villeneuve, watched by Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, led the Canadian Grand Prix – a first. Gilles was out in front for the fourth time in his career. The first was at Long Beach, when he came off track in a misguided attempt to lap Clay Regazzoni. He had been in the lead for a few laps in Austria and many more in the tragic Italian Grand Prix, where he was penalised a minute for jumping the start. Villeneuve feared that something would go wrong again and after the race spoke about those moments and said, “Those last laps were torture. I could hear all kinds of noises in the car. […] I was having to drive like an old woman, shifting at 10,000rpm instead of 11,500 and I just kept saying to myself: Ferrari is the best. It doesn’t break. It never breaks!” The first Canadian Grand Prix held in Quebec concluded half an hour later and it was the Ferrari of Gilles first past the chequered flag.

A month later the Formula 1 Championship moved to Scheckter’s home territory, and this time Ferrari introduced the new 312 T4. Jean-Pierre Jabouille took pole in qualifying at Kyalami but the Renault proved fragile, and both he and René Arnoux were forced to retire, opening the way for a Ferrari one-two finish. Villeneuve beat Scheckter to the line by just over three seconds and then repeated that feat at Long Beach to bounce to the top of the standings. Back in Europe, Ligier triumphed in Spain but while Scheckter finished in fourth place, Villeneuve didn’t get any points. The same thing happened again in Belgium where Scheckter won to join Laffite at the top of the standings. Two weeks later, the South African got the upper hand in the drivers’ rankings, thanks to his win at Monaco, also putting Ferrari at the top of the Constructors’ points. On July 1, Villeneuve and Arnoux wrote one of the most brilliant pages in Formula 1 history with a sparkling duel between the Ferrari and Renault cars in the final laps of the French GP. In the end, the French constructor won its first Grand Prix with Jabouille, but all eyes were on the battle for second place as Gilles and René continually swapped positions, delivering one brilliant pass after another and going wheel to wheel to the very last second.

In a manoeuvre that no other driver would even have attempted he passed Jones on the outside at the Tarzan Corner on lap 11, but picked up a puncture and had to drive a full lap on three wheels before being forced to pull off the track.

Ferrari’s technical gamble centred not so much around the performance guaranteed by the turbocharged engines but the fact that the car’s acceleration and handling were so ill-suited to the torturous Monegasque circuit.","excerpt":"","audioId":"653a7351-3cae-4cfb-a4d9-7ac9891b9bc3","background":{"landscapeBig":"5d06843c3ad9250aee5324d6","portraitMedium":"5d068467107b060e8f527a89"},"backgroundMobile":{"landscapeMedium":"5d06843c3ad9250aee5324d6","portraitMedium":"5d068467107b060e8f527a89"},"blocks":[{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d06843c3ad9250aee5324d6","portraitMedium":"5d06848a107b060e8f527a8a"}},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Nonetheless, the Canadian and his Ferrari 126 CK went on to write a whole new chapter in Formula 1 history on the city circuit. This was the first Monaco Grand Prix to be won by a turbo engine, the first victory for a Ferrari turbo-engined car, the first win too after a gap of year and a half. All in all, it broke the hex, and put both Gilles and the Ferrari car back at centre stage. Of all the victories Gilles delivered in the course of his career, Monaco was probably the least spectacular or memorable. That said, there was still something special about it because just before the weekend, Ferrari announced that its partnership with Villeneuve would continue for a further two seasons. Qualifying went very well for the Canadian whose driving seemed inspired from the outset. He even started from the first row alongside Piquet on pole who’d qualified just 78 thousandths faster in the Brabham. The race started an hour late because water used by the fire services to put out a blaze in the kitchens of the Loews Hotel flooded the tunnel. Once it did begin, however, Nelson Piquet quickly broke away from the pack along the torturous 3.312 km track. The 1981 Monaco Grand Prix proved something of an elimination race. In the course of the 76 scheduled laps, many of the drivers came to grief, including the Brazilian who crashed out as he attempted to lap Cheever and Tambay. Reigning World Champion Alan Jones took the lead and looked set for a comfortable victory as he held a 30-second-plus lead over his nearest rival, Villeneuve. But then, just seven laps from the finish, the Williams driver had to pit because of a fuel feed problem. When he returned to the race, he was still in the lead but now had to deal with pressure from Villeneuve who had scented victory and began delivering one race fastest lap after another. The Canadian pushed his Ferrari nearer and nearer the limit corner after corner, driving near and nearer the guardrails every lap. But the driver who’d earned himself the nickname “the Aviator” for his many spectacular accidents, never put a foot wrong. He had fun with the rolling Monegasque circuit, unleashing his car’s power through the tunnel and all the way to the Tabac before waltzing it through audacious race lines between the Mirabeau and the Loews Hairpin."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"e920ae1b-e57e-4650-a67a-8828a9ccd2a0"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"Four laps from the finish, Villeneuve had the tail of Jones’ William firmly in his sights.

The Ferrari driver continued to press on and, thanks to the fact that his rival developed a fuel pump problem, shot across the finish-line to victory more than 40 seconds ahead of the rest of the field. Villeneuve was visibly exhausted on the podium but photographs of his beaming face as he was sprayed with champagne, went around the world like wildfire.

The weight of the 308 GTB was reduced by the use of aluminium and fibreglass in its construction instead of steel. The first model, with the chassis no. 8380, left the Padua workshop in 1978. Eleven were built up to 1984 while one was put together by a craftsman in the UK. Its first victory came in 1979 at the Monza Rally, with Raffaele “Lele” Pinto and Claudio Penariol. Two years later, the Ferrari 308 Gr4 won the first of two victories in the Tour de France Automobile, with Jean-Claude Andruet driving it for Charles Pozzi’s team, for which the versatile Frenchman had also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1972 with the 365 GTB/4. Chantal Bouchetal was his navigator in the Tour de France. Andruet repeated the feat in 1982, a great year for the 308 Gr4 .He had another woman at his side, known as “Biche”, but whose real name was Michele Espinosi-Petit. Pioneer’s sponsorship brought a change of colour from red to blue and the car was so beautiful that in 2016 a customer wanted his Ferrari 488 in the same colours. The car, produced by Tailor Made Ferrari, was unveiled to the public at the Grand Palais, at the annual re-enactment of the French race. The 308 Gr4 also won the constructors’ and drivers’ titles of the 1982 Italian Rally Championship, with Tonino Tognana and Massimo De Antoni in the Jolly Club team car. The season was very hard fought, opening with a win at the Targa Florio in March. It was actually a double victory, because Andruet and “Biche” finished second. Tognana and De Antoni triumphed again in the Ciocco Rally, while at Collina Romagna they secured an important second place, behind the Lancia of Fabrizio Tabaton and Luciano Tedeschini. The third victory of the season came in September, this time in the Piancavallo Rally in the province of Pordenone.

Priority was given to customers on the West Coast of the US, especially California, where the very first vehicles in the series were sent. After that, production began for the European market. Pininfarina masterfully succeeded in giving the soft-top car the same silhouette as the coupé version. The soft-top model was anchored at the base of the two uprights of the rear window, folding into a concealed compartment behind the rear seats separated by an armrest, despite that area also housing the engine. At that time, the technology for manual soft-tops was yet to be developed. That is why the roof was rather complex and delicate to handle, in order to avoid causing damage when folding. That said, from an aesthetic point of view the Mondial Cabriolet was a success. Like the coupé, the Cabriolet was restyled twice, in 1985 and 1989, giving rise to the Mondial 3.2 and Mondial T.

This design stands out for its original stylistic solutions, such as different width between the front and rear track, or the repetition of the grilling of the side air intakes on the fascia covering the rear lights, but now rectangular rather than round. Although the Testarossa played with the concept of different volumes at the front and rear of the car, the final result is particularly harmonious and indeed unique. This choice was purely technical and showed once again how Ferrari puts style at the service of mechanical solutions. The designers of the Testarossa created an “unbalanced” layout on the rear, placing the radiators there in order to eliminate the hot water pipes. Pininfarina transformed a potential limitation into an opportunity and created a shape that could convey the flow along the sides where the radiators were positioned. To hide them from view, the designer came up with the car’s iconic stretch of horizontal spoilers that fit harmoniously into the three-dimensional shapes of the tail."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"7910afdd-af80-4c58-9b43-18dd23ffd317"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"However, it was not just the style that left people speechless.

The project was headed by a heavy design hitter Mauro Forghieri. After leaving Ferrari’s GES division to devote himself to advanced research, the designer used the 308 GTB’s running gear as his starting point, bestowing it with some very surprising solutions derived directly from Formula 1. A very successful attempt to meld the mid-rear-engined sports car concept with the very finest technology of the day, the GTO turned out to be extreme on every level. In fact, it was the first car to be built using innovative composites – Kevlar, for example, was used for the bodyshell. It is also the first production car with Formula 1-derived electronic fuel injection which boosted the delivery of the 400 hp generated by its V8 engine. Its displacement was also cut to 2,855cc, to comply with Group B rules, and sported twin IHI turbochargers and intercoolers, one per cylinder bank, just like the Formula 1 single-seaters. The GTO also unleashed a spectacular top speed of 305 km/h, making it quite literally uncatchable by any other production car of the day. Because of its close links to Formula 1, Ferrari also involved its two Scuderia drivers for the 1984 season, René Arnoux and Michele Alboreto, in its development. In fact, Enzo Ferrari frequently appeared more interested in how the GTO’s development was progressing rather than that year’s Formula 1 car, the Ferrari 126 C4. The GTO was something of a throwback to the glorious competition Gran Turismos of the past, even though the FISA abolished Group B before the car could race. The car’s name also references the 250 GTO, probably the most iconic car in Prancing Horse history. Its Pininfarina styling was inspired by the lines of the 308 GTB and the aerodynamic study for the 308 GTB Speciale, better known as the “Millechiodi”.\n\n\n\n"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"4f8eb085-f8cf-4d4b-bde3-8dc496e9f529"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"However, it pushed those lines and forms to new extremes to make them as aerodynamically efficient as they were aggressive.

The Scuderia’s sporting director Marco Piccinini travelled to the US to watch several races and had talks with the organisers of the series. In Maranello, a work group headed by young Austrian engineer Gustav Brunner was set up specifically for it. From the outset, however, it was clear that the project would only be successful if Ferrari collaborated with teams that regularly competed in the CART championship. Leo Mehl, a motor racing executive at Goodyear, which manufactured Ferrari’s F1 tyres and was also the sole supplier for the US series, recommended the Truesport team. It had turned its 1985 CART season around in the final six races which Bobby Rahal won in the March 85C. The latter was a successful driver in the US but had also competed in two F1 Grands Prix at the end of the 1970s for Wolf. This was also the single-seater that was used as the starting point for the development of the new Ferrari. After a secret test carried out by Michele Alboreto at Fiorano, Brunner’s team which included, amongst others, Harvey Postlethwaite andAntonio Bellentani, threw itself into developing the car and, in doing so, came up with original and entirely innovative takes on certain technical concepts then in vogue in the US championships. Brunner studied, researched, experimented and spent endless hours in the wind tunnel, honing the forms and aerodynamics of the single-seater. He also made many trips to the US and watched both CART races and tests, not least the Indy500. The results of the research conducted back in Maranello were promising too and the project ploughed ahead at full steam. A year later, in September 1986, the 637 was ready for the track and Alboreto was, once again, selected to do the testing. The single-seater instantly proved competitive and, above all, was radically different from the other cars in the series. Its nosecone in particular featured lines and solutions that would not be seen elsewhere for many years to come. A member of the international press was also invited to the tests as Ferrari wanted to be sure his message to the FIA arrived loud and clear."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"57277215-0fbe-4272-97dd-aca1d30eca79"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"The ploy worked and negotiations were soon underway with the Federation, marking a political victory for Ferrari who confirmed that the Scuderia was committed to continuing in Formula 1.

That said, Ferrari also wanted the F40 to deliver a uniquely powerful emotional impact on more than just its drivers. The F40 was the state-of-the-art in terms of its power, thanks to a twin-turbo 90° V8 engine that generated almost 160 CV/litre by virtue of twin intercoolers and IHI turbos, punching out a total of 478 CV. An engineering masterpiece supported by a central integrated tubular steel and composite structure of a kind previously only used in the Formula 1 single-seaters. This solution worked well with a tubular steel chassis to which Kevlar reinforcement panels were bonded guaranteeing three times the torsional rigidity of a regular road car. The result was that the F40 weighed just 1,100 kg. This fact combined with a set-up and suspensions adjustable to three different heights to suit different speeds, guaranteed the model astonishing road-holding and extreme performance figures, most notably a top speed of 324 km/h and 0 to 100 km/h acceleration in just 4.1 seconds."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"f0babe4f-d49b-4e5e-bcc9-ada1c7fa278d"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Enzo Ferrari’s final and definitive car’s styling was, of course, well on a par with its technological prowess.

On 14 January, accompanied by his loyal driver Dino Tagliazucchi, he went to the Maranello town hall for a very important meeting. He and the Mayor of Modena, Alfonsina Rinaldi, signed the papers authorising the demolition of the old Scuderia headquarters in Viale Trento e Trieste. A little over two weeks later he made his final public appearance, when on 1 February he received an honorary physics degree from the University of Modena. The ceremony took place at the city hall and what struck the keenest observers present was that Ferrari looked exhausted. It seemed that the years had finally begun to catch up with him. Just over two weeks later he celebrated his 90th birthday, an event that gives us a good idea of how the founder saw things. There was to be no public ceremony, no authorities invited to participate, but simply a “family event” open “to people on the payroll,” as Ferrari ordered. The family sat down to eat on the production lines with about 1700 people, with a huge field kitchen outside. Employees received a model of the F40, the last car personally signed off by Ferrari, along with a silver commemorative medal. The menu was typically Emilian: ham, sausage, cracklings, mortadella, fried dumplings and pickled vegetables as an hors d’oeuvres accompanied by Malvasia wine; tortellini pasta with cream and lasagne for the first course and Zampone of Modena with beans and a veal cutlet with baked vegetables for the main.

It was tried and tested in Formula 1 and is now standard on all self-respecting sports cars. Thirty years ago, however, this was far from the case. In fact, the mere idea was unimaginable. Back in 1979, the Scuderia had developed an electrohydraulic gearbox and tested it on a 312 T3 laboratory car. Rather than the traditional gear lever inside the cockpit, Ferrari’s unique system used two buttons on the steering wheel to change the gears. The buttons activated electromagnetic valves that, in turn, activated actuators in the gearbox. However, the advanced electronics required to make the system work were not yet available and it was mothballed. That said, the experiment was not in vain. Ten years later, now armed with new technology, Ferrari went down the same route and, in the process, ushered in a whole new era in Formula 1, courtesy of the revolutionary F1-89 (design no. 640), the brainchild of John Barnard. A car that was, to all intents and purposes, the first of the present generation of electronically-managed single-seaters. The new F1-89 sported an innovative aerodynamic body, push-rod suspension with torsion bars, and the latest iteration of the naturally-aspirated V12 which punched out 600 bhp at 12,000 rpm.

The Frenchman was fourth, behind the two McLarens of former Ferrari driver Gerhard Berger and Senna. The tyres were the main concern ahead of the race, with the fear that two pit stops would be needed to complete the race. But one previously insignificant team had an ace up its sleeve. Leyton House, formerly March, had a car that adhered so tightly to the regulations that drivers Ivan Capelli and Mauricio Gugelmin failed even to qualify in Mexico. The designer, 27-year-old Adrian Newey, had just left the team, but before leaving he introduced an aerodynamic update on the CG901 that really suited the Le Castellet track. While all the teams were concentrated on finishing the race on only one stop, Leyton House was preparing a coup: to finish the race without a pit stop. At the start Berger overtook Mansell while Senna was third ahead of Prost. The early part of the race was slow and it was the tyre changes that made the difference. Prost’s car came into the pits on Lap 26 and set off again seven seconds later. Shortly after, Mansell also stopped while the McLarens stayed out until after lap 30. Senna overtook Berger who lost 12 seconds in the pits, not a good stop but it was nothing compared to what Senna would lose – 16 seconds – on his later pit stop.

The design of the tail and the cockpit also drew inspiration from the “Daytona” – the car’s shape is quite modern but contains classic elements referring to the history of the company. The motorised spoiler underneath the tail panel provides a special, almost imperceptible aerodynamic effect: its angle of incidence varies depending on the speed and acts on the downforce of the car. As with all other models in the range, the car was designed from the outset for all world markets, with a specific version for the American market. However, while previous GT 2+2 models could come with an automatic transmission, the 456 GT was initially offered only with manual transmission.

Just a year later, the idea took shape of creating a high-level single-make championship. Contact was made with the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) to guarantee the highest standards of safety would be met. Ferrari also entered into talks with some of Italy and Europe’s finest and most spectacularly beautiful circuits to allow clients to compete on suitably atmospheric tracks. From the very earliest stage of the rule drafting process, it was decided to allow only official Ferrari dealerships to compete to guarantee absolute transparency in performance terms. The Prancing Horse officially announced the launch of the Ferrari Challenge at Mugello in the autumn of 1992. It would span an Italian and a European series, each comprising six rounds of which the final one would be shared. On that same day, Ferrari also unveiled the TB and TS versions of the 348 Challenge, the car chosen for the series. In line with the tradition of allowing road cars to be converted into racing versions, the 348 was equipped with a special kit which, once removed, returned the car to its original configuration. The kit comprised a roll cage, six-point safety harnesses, 18” magnesium wheels, a fire extinguisher, front and rear tow hooks, and an electric circuit breaker. The 348 Challenge’s engine unleashed 320 horses, 20 or so more than the road version. The brakes too were boosted. The Italian series was first to debut with its maiden round getting underway at Monza on March 28. The first ever Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli race was won by Paolo Rossi in car no. 5, an almost fluorescent 348. Race 2 was won by Roberto Ragazzi who went on to become the Ferrari Challenge’s first champion at the end of the season. The first round of the European series, on the other hand, took place at Magny-Cours, just a week later and both races were dominated by Bernd Hahne, brother of 1970s Formula 1 driver, Hubert. The German also won the first European title and triumphed at the Finalissima at Mugello. The Ferrari single-make championship proved such an instant international success that it was decided to launch a North American series in 1994. Celebrities of the likes of singer Eros Ramazzotti and sports personalities such as skier Kristian Ghedina frequently appear in the Italian and European series.

Obviously Ferrari technicians profoundly revised and optimised the unit fitted to the F512 M, particularly in terms of its thermodynamic characteristics and kinematics, with undoubted benefits for maximum power, now increased to 440 hp. The increase in power provided improved acceleration over the previous model and, because various parts of the car were now lighter, there was also a better power to weight ratio. The letter “M” that appears next to the F512, and that indicates the “Modified” version of the car, was no mere marketing operation, but emphasises the in-depth work carried out on every part of the model. This can be seen, for example, in the improved aerodynamic penetration, achieved through big changes to the lines and the shape both at the nose and the tail. However, the Pininfarina designers and Maranello engineers focussed mainly on the front.\n"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"1c80242d-97d7-4d2a-9ea3-548b7e02df00"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"The new nose line was closely related to that of the 355 model and with the style of the 456 GT 2 + 2.

However, Formula 1’s direct influence wasn’t limited solely to the engine (the 12-cylinder sported by the 640 and 641 fielded by Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost, albeit boosted from 3,500 to 4,698 cc), it also impacted the car’s overall concept. Just like the single-seater, the engine was a weight-bearing member with the push-rod rear suspension mated to it. The front suspensions, which attached to the carbon-fibre chassis, were inspired by those of the 1980s 126 C too. The use of cutting-edge materials also pointed to the F50’s close links with the Formula 1 cars.. The engineers used everything from carbon-fibre to titanium for the con rods and front hubs, and magnesium and aluminium alloy for the wheel rims. The rear hubs, on the other hand, adopted a solution invented and patented by Ferrari for its single-seaters that reduces power loss. Crafted once again by Pininfarina, the F50’s styling took 2,000 hours of wind tunnel testing to perfect and effortlessly combined iconic styling features with extreme technical and aerodynamic demands.

It looked like the race would start behind the Safety Car but at the last moment the race director decided that it could go ahead as normal. The cars set off gingerly over the soaking wet Catalan asphalt, and Schumacher had one of the worst starts, slipping to seventh place by the first corner, behind his team-mate Eddie Irvine. Meanwhile, the race director’s decision proved way off the mark with five cars retiring in the first lap alone. Irvine joined them on the second lap, going into a spin and his engine stalling. On lap 3 Schumacher was already in a battle with the Benetton of Gerhard Berger for fourth place, although the duel quickly became one for third place because, in the meantime, race leader Hill had spun.

Indeed, the F355 Berlinetta was the first car with a shape that optimised the disposal and control of the air flows in the underbody, ensuring a constant interaction between the vehicle and the ground to the advantage of road holding. The engine itself was the subject of study and transfer of technology from the track, providing the F355 with extremely high performance: 109 hp/litre. Specific power and torque were the result of the adoption of a head with five valves per cylinder and electronic fuel injection. On top of this already superb base, Ferrari decided to introduce a revolutionary element from Formula 1: a semi-automatic gearbox with steering wheel controls. This technological innovation was developed for single-seaters as early as 1979, thanks to Mauro Forghieri’s intuition, but was only brought to the track in 1989 when Nigel Mansell and his 640 F1 won in Brazil, in its debut season.

The work took a year and a half and while obviously the primary aim of a wind tunnel is efficiency, it is equally true that Ferrari, the icon of style, would hardly settle for a conventional and inelegant structure. So the project thus came to involve one of the world’s most famous architects, an Italian and native of Genoa, Renzo Piano. The giant simulator stands on undulating ground in the area where the new Ferrari citadel was to be constructed, with beautifully designed and highly efficient buildings. Piano decided to leave the structure exposed to bring out its technical components, such as the engines required to generate the airflow, conceiving the tunnel as a giant tubular duct closed at each end by a C-section, 80 by 70 metres… As already said, the new wind tunnel can handle 1:2 models, simulating speeds approaching 250 km/h, or it can accommodate the real car itself (1:1 model) at speeds of up to 150 km/h. The electrical substation that feeds the system contains 6000 kW installations, enough power to light about 2000 apartments. The fan is about five metres in diameter and is equipped with a 2200 kW turbine, the equivalent of five Formula 1 engines.

The season opened in Melbourne, Australia, where reigning champions McLaren monopolised the front row. Unfortunately Michael Schumacher’s championship began in the same way that 1998 had concluded. Clutch trouble caused his engine to stall on the grid meaning he had to start from the back. The McLarens surged ahead, only to break down one after the other within a few laps. The race was won by Ferrari͛s Eddie Irvine – the first in his career. What everyone was eagerly anticipating, however, was the duel between Mika Hakkinen and Michael Schumacher who were back in the mix from the next race. The Finnish McLaren driver won in Brazil, but the German triumphed at Imola, in front of ecstatic fans, and Monaco, where Ferrari pulled off a one-two. Hakkinen took victory in Spain and again in Canada where Schumacher ended his race after colliding with the ͚Wall of Champions͛. The rain-soaked French GP instead saw an outsider, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, take the flag in the Jordan. The British Grand Prix took place on 11 July, at Silverstone. The two McLarens led at the start, pursued by Irvine and Schumacher. Jacques Villeneuve and Alex Zanardi were stuck on the grid so the race was red flagged. However, the front-runners were now at Stowe corner, where Schumacher tried an attack on Irvine. But Schumacher had a brake problem, which caused him to crash into the tyre wall at high speed. He immediately tried to pull himself out of the cockpit, but he quickly realised his right leg was injured and let himself drop back into the car. The impact had broken his tibia and fibula.

Eddie still led though, two points ahead of Hakkinen. In the next three races Salo and Irvine collected a miserly eight and four points respectively, but that was enough for the McLaren driver to regain the championship lead with only two races to go. Schumacher made his big come-back in Malaysia, and after taking pole position acted as the perfect team driver by letting Irvine pass at the start while slowing Hakkinen down and forcing him into third place. Irvine arrived for the finale in Japan, two weeks later, with a four-point lead, the same that Ferrari held over McLaren in the Constructors’ championship. Eddie’s weekend immediately became complicated. He left the track disastrously during qualifying, dropping him down on the grid. Schumacher took pole but Hakkinen overtook him at the start. Schumacher managed to keep to within just a few seconds of the Finn, but was unable to pull of an attack that would have made Irvine’s third place count. Hakkinen won the world championship, with Irvine just two points behind. Ferrari could at least count on the Constructors’ title, its first in many years.

At the A1 Ring he was bumped by the BAR of Ricardo Zonta sending him into a spin and into the path of the Jordan of Jarno Trulli who he couldn’t avoid, while in Germany the Benetton of Giancarlo Fisichella collided with him. With zero points from three races Coulthard and Hakkinen were just two points behind the Ferrari driver. The Scuderia was kept afloat by Barrichello who at Hockenheim, after starting in 18th, won his first victory in Formula 1 racing with dry tyres despite the rain falling on half the almost seven kilometres of track. Hakkinen won at the Hungaroring beating Michael and taking two-point lead on him in the standings. The next race was at Spa-Francorchamps. The Finn dominated in qualifying and took command at the start of the race on a drying track. On lap 13 Hakkinen spun after his wheels slid on a wet white stripe: Schumacher took advantage to move into the lead. At that point, the McLaren driver launched a furious comeback and was right on the tail of the Ferrari with eight laps to go. The first US Grand Prix on the new circuit in the Indianapolis basin raised great hopes for Ferrari. With a one-two and the withdrawal of Hakkinen, Schumacher moved into an eight-point lead. Michael took pole on 8 October in Japan, but Hakkinen pulled ahead at the start. He needed to remedy the situation with strategy because it is nigh on impossible to overtake on the track.

The British driver would prove to be Schumacher’s only real rival that season as he turned consistency into his greatest strength. Michael was forced to retire from the race at Imola but then won both the Spanish Grand Prix and the European GP at the Nürburgring. Often that year he found himself doing battle with his younger brother, Ralf, who himself had become one of the top drivers in the sport, racing for Williams. His team-mate, Columbian Juan Pablo Montoya, would engage the Ferrari driver in some spectacular duels too in the course of the season. Michael Schumacher, however, took a definitive lead in the title race at the French Grand Prix which he won ahead of Coulthard who finished third. At that point in the season, the German had a 31-point lead over his rival – the equivalent of three grands prix. The results in the Constructors’ standings looked even more promising. Thanks to Barrichello who, although he wasn’t winning, often featured on the podium, Ferrari had racked up 108 points compared to McLaren’s 56.On August 19, holidaymakers everywhere clustered around TVs showing the Formula 1 action.

Many of the drivers felt that the grand prix should not go ahead, particularly as both titles had already been won, but the FOM insisted they all race. As a mark of respect and mourning, Ferrari removed all sponsor logos from its cars and uniforms, and painted the single-seaters’ nosecones black.

Ferrari was so ahead of the game, in fact, that the Scuderia fielded the previous year’s F2001 in the first round of the season in Australian. At that point, the team was still lapping the F2002 back at Fiorano to improve its reliability. But on the performance front there was no issue at all. It was already delivering. And how… Schumacher won the Australian Grand Prix and was second in Malaysia in the F2001 before debuting the new car which proceeded to win its maiden race at the demanding Interlagos Circuit . At Imola, Barrichello, who’d had a very unlucky season thus far, was also given an F2002, and he and Schumacher immediately delivered their first one-two finish of the season. The German champion then went on to win in Spain, Austria, Canada and Great Britain, while his rivals took turns standing beside him on the podium, nabbing points from each other in the process. Barrichello, for his part, won the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. By the time the French Grand Prix came around, Michael had a 54-point lead over Juan Pablo Montoya of Williams. The race started out as a three-pronged sparring match between Montoya, Schumacher and a young McLaren driver called Kimi Räikkönen. Michael attacked Montoya but the Finn passed him at the Adelaide hairpin. Räikkönen looked set for victory when, five laps from the finish, he locked up and went wide after hitting oil from Olivier Panis’Toyota. Schumacher took very shrewd advantage and shot past the McLaren to be first over the line. That victory combined with his rivals’ results, gave him his fifth World Drivers’ title, equalling the record set by 1950s racing hero Juan Manuel Fangio. It was still only July 21 but the game was over. Ferrari had to wait until the Hungarian GP on August 18 to secure the Constructors’ title.

Victory seemed assured in the Monaco Grand Prix but then the Monte-Carlo roulette wheel spun and stopped instead on number seven, Jarno Trulli. In fact, a paradoxical incident put Schumacher out of the race while the Safety Car was deployed. The Ferrari driver was in the lead, but alternating between accelerating and braking to keep the brakes of his F2004 warm. Inside, the tunnel there was a misunderstanding with Juan Pablo Montoya. To avoid hitting the Ferrari, the Williams driver hung a sharp right. Schumacher, who had not noticed him, also swung right. A collision was inevitable and the German’s car ended up against the barrier, wrecking his front suspension. It was, however, just a blip as Michael immediately returned to obliterating the competition from the next race, the European Grand Prix, at the Nürburgring on May 30. His victory in the Eiffel Mountains marked the start of a string of seven triumphs, ending at the Hungarian Grand Prix in mid-August. The most memorable of these included the French Grand Prix on July 4. At this point, Ferrari’s strategists had blind faith in Michael’s ability to beat the Renault of Fernando Alonso, and decided on a four-stop strategy."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"45695711-21f0-44a2-88a2-cd69dc70516b"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"To win, Schumacher would have to drive almost 70 laps as hard as if he were in qualifying.

However, Schumacher had to wait until the following GP in Belgium, for his seventh title, an achievement that no other driver has ever even come close to equalling. The legendary German driver was second behind the McLaren of Kimi Räikkönen on the day, but it mattered not a whit: he had clinched the title a full five races before the end of the season. Schumacher and Barrichello, who won in Italy and also took the very first GP ever staged in China, triumphed in 15 out of 18 races that season, absolutely obliterating the competition and setting a slew of new records. Michael took 82% of the available points. He finished the season 34 points ahead of Barrichello and a massive 63 in front of Button. Ferrari was the undisputed king of Formula 1. It had won every Constructors’ Cup since 1999, while Schumacher had delivered five consecutive Drivers’titles since 2000, a feat that made him far and away the most successful driver not just in Ferrari, but also Formula 1 history.

The main surface of the roof was made of an electrochemical glass panel allowing the driver to operate a dashboard control that could adjust the amount of light inside the car from 4 to 40%. The roof had another special feature too – designed by Fioravanti – using of a rolling mechanism for its opening. Made out of carbon fibre, it was very light, causing minimal variance in the centre of gravity between its closed and open configurations. The new roof concept, integrated with electrochromic glass technology applied to large glass surfaces, enabled the car to morph in seconds from coupè to convertible, adding the functional advantages of the coupè to the traditional advantages of open-top models. Ferrari first used the name Superamerica between 1956 and 1961. It marked a number of models, all strictly 12-cylinder and produced in limited series. This model was no exception. Built on the base of the 575M Maranello, the Superamerica used what was then the latest development of the Ferrari 12-cylinder engine, boosted to 540 hp. The full integration of the roof opening system and the electrically actuated kinematics made the Superamerica the world’s fastest convertible, with a top speed of 320 km/h. The styling of the Ferrari Superamerica, entrusted to Pininfarina, made it possible to respect the balance of volumes typical of a Maranello 12-cylinder engine, while at the same time providing an original integration of the car’s most distinctive function: the “Revochromic” roof. This innovative component connected to the car body thanks to its two side fins that refer to Ferraris of the past and that, in the Superamerica, also serve the roll-bar function in synergy with the roof and windscreen.\n"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"fe78ba81-417c-4ff3-ae3e-b0d67e25e384"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"The front view stood out thanks to the new look of the headlight covers and the air intake on the bonnet, both were aluminium in colour.

McLaren won in Germany while Felipe looked set for victory in Hungary after a brilliant pass of Hamilton. Luck, however, was not on his side and three laps from the finish, his engine failed. Kovalainen took full advantage to deliver the only victory of his career. The Brazilian redeemed himself at Valencia, in the European GP and in Belgium at the end of a lengthy sparring match with Hamilton. Monza brought the second tumultuous round of the season. Young German driver Sebastian Vettel took a surprising pole on the Saturday in a Toro Rosso powered by a Ferrari engine. Everyone suspected it was a stroke of good luck due to the rain but in the race itself, which was also held in the wet, Sebastian proved himself genuinely talented. For the first and so far only time in history, a non-Ferrari single-seater powered by a Maranello-built engine took victory. It was a fairly colourless showing from Massa and Hamilton, who were now vying virtually neck-and-neck for the title with the Brazilian just a point behind the Englishman."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"3446fbce-ea9f-4ed2-a57c-b438f585f3fe"},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"Singapore brought a serious setback for Felipe. The Brazilian pitted while the Safety Car was out after Nelsinho Piquet’s accident (which later proved deliberate). Unfortunately, he pulled off from the pit box with the fuel hose still attached to his F2008. It was the end of the race for the Brazilian who was leading at the time. In the last round of the season at Interlagos, Felipe was chasing Hamilton who was seven points ahead. This was the same points gap Räikkönen had made up the previous year but it seemed unlikely the miracle would repeat itself two seasons in a row. The Constructors’ Championship situation was less worrying as Ferrari held an 11-point lead on McLaren. At the start, the track was wet but beginning to dry off. Massa took the lead. Behind him things were getting complicated for Hamilton who ended up off the track after an attempted pass and dropped back to seventh. If Felipe won, Lewis would need to finish at least fifth. On lap 43, he made his way up to where he needed to be and Massa’s work seemed for nothing. However, late in the race, it started to rain once again, mixing up the positions. All the cars pitted aside from the two Toyotas that took the gamble of staying out on dry tyres. Three laps from the finish, Massa was leading and Hamilton lying only sixth. Felipe shot under the chequered flag to a huge roar from the Sao Paolo home crowd and, for a few short moments, was technically World Champion. Hamilton, however, had not given up and, helped by the rain, was upping the ante out on the track, In fact, he passed the Toyota of Timo Glock at the last corner on the final lap, to win the title by a single point.

The 458 Italia also benefits from Ferrari’s experience in Formula 1 from which it adopts precision and immediacy in response to the driver’s commands. Also, the instrument panel was developed on the basis of input from the single-seater, for the first time giving the driver a series of parameters to help optimise performance. Seven-time Formula 1 world champion, Michael Schumacher, also contributed to the design of this car. Designed by Pininfarina, it has an aerodynamic efficiency that optimises downforce and cuts drag by reducing the air intake front section of the radiator. The 4.5 litre engine is Maranello’s first centrally mounted V8 fuel injection engine. It is capable of 570 horsepower and is assisted by an F1 dual-clutch gearbox with seven gears. The 458 Italia accelerates from 0-100 km/h in under 3.4 seconds and has a top speed of 325 km/h, delivering outstanding performance combined with perfect safety thanks to the E-Diff and F1-Trac electronic systems alongside the newly developed ABS. The 458 Italia was the star of the Frankfurt Motor Show from its very first day and over the following years won a record number of awards among which the Car of the Year by Robb Report, the BBC Top Gear Car of the Year and Supercar of the Year and a similar recognition from the German magazine Auto Motor und Sport. The engine also won awards as “Best Performance Engine” and “Best Engine Above 4-litre” in 2011, 2012 and 2014 as part of the International Engine of the Year. The 458 of course has also triumphed on track: four versions have been produced. The GT2, then GTE, for the main Endurance competitions, the GT3 for all other GT championships and the Grand-Am version for races on American soil.

The kind of challenges that the most uncompromising and discerning drivers could set it, drivers who demand their cars give their all. That is why it didn’t pass unnoticed, and was talked about even before its presentation at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. But anyone who, at least initially, looked at this new model with distrust bordering on incredulity, was soon compelled to change their mind. To anyone who argued that Enzo Ferrari would not have approved of the FF, his son, Piero Ferrari, left no room for doubt: “My father would have adored this car, because it is innovative, revolutionary and is a true four-seater, like the Ferraris he used on a daily basis.” This clear opinion, with no room for doubt, best describes the first four-wheel drive Ferrari that combined extreme performance with the usability of a genuine GT with a highly innovative design. Innovation was clear in every aspect of the car, beginning with the engine, the first direct-injection V12 coupled with an F1 dual-clutch gearbox with seven gears. It has an output of 660 hp, with an extreme sports performance, evident by the top speed of 335 km/h. It was the most exclusive GT on the market, the ultimate expression of the “extreme grand tourer”, the most powerful 4-seater in the world.

This intensive work has yielded excellent results, as shown in the record aerodynamic values of the F12 Berlinetta, with its 123 kilos of downforce at 200 km/h, and DC of 0.299. These results were also obtained through the introduction of a highly innovative solution, the Aero Bridge, which –for the first time – uses the bonnet to generate downforce, diverting the flow from the top of the car to the flanks. Aerodynamic efficiency was optimised by the use of the Active Brake Cooling system of guide vanes. Situated on the brake air ducts, they open when the temperature requires it.

The LaFerrari’s futuristic aerodynamics are the result of integrated work from the initial planning of the vehicle, involving the Ferrari Styling Centre team and the design and development engineers. This engineering synergy has integrated the active aerodynamics and the hybrid system with the car’s other dynamic control systems to ensure record-breaking performance in all conditions. Indeed, integration with the car controls and dynamic parameters ensures that the active aerodynamics continually adjust to refine downforce and balance through front and rear devices. In this way the LaFerrari combines maximum downforce and minimum drag coefficient in all driving conditions to produce the fastest road car in Maranello’s history. Form married with function. Technology transfer from Formula 1 to production models is one of the historic prerogatives of the Prancing Horse. The LaFerrari is the ultimate synthesis of the know-how gained in Formula 1 and in the creation of road cars, in Maranello’s most ambitious attempt to redefine the limits of automotive technology. With the HY-KERS system it is the most powerful and efficient Ferrari ever. The application of the KERS system, tested on the racetrack and evolved specifically for use on a road car, ensures perfect integration between the V12 and the electric motor, seamlessly combining the advantages of the two propulsion systems.The design and construction of the chassis was an area of close almost symbiotic collaboration in terms of technology transfer between Formula 1 and road cars. A team of the Scuderia and GT- Technical Department engineers and technicians worked from the early stages of the project with input from Rory Byrne, designer of Prancing Horse single-seaters from 1990 to 2000, yielding 11 world titles in Formula1. The chassis is made entirely in-house at Maranello, with the same materials, facilities and production processes used by the Scuderia. Just like in Formula 1, it employs aeronautically derived “pre-preg” compounds: using four composites because each area is designed to meet specific functional requirements. The driving position is also directly derived from F1: with a fixed seat and adjustable steering column and pedals, providing a perfect setup for each driver. The thin red line of Ferrari tradition turns into a strip of asphalt in front of the driver, on which they can enjoy yet another of Maranello’s jewels.\n"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d08e5bb139a340ac582a42f","portraitMedium":""}},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"2013 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["f138","458-speciale","laferrari"]},"slug":"extreme-innovation","status":"published","publishedAt":"2019-06-18T13:24:16.432Z","id":"5d08e5f82142b5387b1b73c7","original":"5d08e5f82142b5387b1b73c7","createdBy":null,"updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2019-06-18T13:24:08.172Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-30T14:19:46.608Z","expireAt":null,"revision":0,"active":true},{"title":"THE ULTIMATE: Ferrari History","internalTitle":"2014 - THE ULTIMATE","locale":"en","metadata":[{"name":"robots"},{"name":"description","content":"Ferrari FXX K, a laboratory car based on Maranello’s first hybrid, the LaFerrari, which would be used as part of the new research and development programme.

The rear of the car is striking too: the tail is higher and the chord of the spoiler had been extended. A vertical fin and a small wing were also added each side of the tail. These act as guide vanes in the low drag configuration, while in high downforce configuration, they function as endplates to boost the efficiency of the spoiler. The Ferrari FXX K made its track debut in the hands of the Client-Test Drivers in two test days at Imola on June 4 and 5 2015.

Indeed, this car had to provide the same performance as the LaFerrari, but without the roof. Whatismore, the LaFerrari Aperta needed to provide the same handling and the same monstrous performance as the coupé version: 0-100 km/h in less than 3 seconds, a maximum speed of over 350 km/h. In addition, the customer had to be able to drive the car undisturbed by the aerodynamic flows even at 300 km/h. For this reason, in the months prior to its presentation at the Paris Motor Show, the heads of the chassis and aerodynamics department worked hard with the Styling Centre to achieve all of the car’s dynamic and load objectives, without sacrificing the iconic design of the LaFerrari. It is easy to see why work was needed on the chassis: without a roof, it was necessary to share the load lines in the lower part of the body. The end result is a negligible increase in weight, while preserving the torsional and flexural rigidity of the LaFerrari. As with every self-respecting Ferrari roadster, cockpit turbulence is reduced to a minimum. This is possible due to the design of an integrated system, capable of “capturing” the high-speed flow that tends to enter the compartment. The occupants are thus enveloped in quiet up to a top speed of 150 km/h. Although it is an easy bet that the desire to be carried away by the unique excitement of open-air driving, accompanied by the overpowering soundtrack of the first Ferrari hybrid power unit, is likely to gain the upper hand much sooner.\n\n"},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"041ae52a-ff4f-4cec-9000-d790f25b9eb3"},{"type":"focusHorizontal","title":"","description":"Moreover, the V12 that boasts a maximum output of 800 hp, with the addition of a 120 kW electric motor for a total output of 963 hp, is an exceptional performer that no one can resist.

This sparked an intense head-to-head battle with Lewis Hamilton that saw the Ferrari driver roar to the top of the world rankings as the summer break arrived. But in the same period, the company was also reeling from the shock of the unexpected, all-too-early death of its Chairman and CEO Sergio Marchionne. \nMarchionne left a huge legacy which was embraced with fearlessness by new President John Elkann and the new CEO Louis Camilleri who had the task of presenting the new industrial plan that Italian-Canadian executive had worked so hard on. Shareholders were invited to the new Style Centre which was officially opened especially for the occasion, to listen to the two men sharing that vision of the company’s short-term future. Fifteen new cars in three years, a powerful focus on the future through major investment in R\u0026D, and a response to climate change-related problems in the form of a range of which 60% will be hybrid models. \nThat determined focus on tomorrow does not meaning reneging on the extraordinary wealth of creativity and solutions from the past. Rather it reinterprets and lends them new and unique technological and stylistic slants. An approach brilliantly epitomised by the first two products of the Icona project, the Monza SP1 and the Monza SP2, which were unveiled on Capital Market Day. The two cars, a single-seater and a two-seater respectively, both sport the most powerful naturally-aspirated V12 ever built by Ferrari, that of the 812 Superfast. They are the product of a concept that uses some of the most evocative cars from Ferrari history as the leitmotif for a whole new segment of limited edition special series models developed specifically with Ferrari clients and collectors in mind. Cars inspired by the barchette of the 1950s which were driven to victory in the international championships not just by the Scuderia Ferrari’s works drivers but also by gentlemen drivers who often raced against the legendary big names of the day. \n"},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"5d09eae79d16620aaf2780f4","portraitMedium":"5d09eae79d16620aaf2780f4"}},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"The new models officially debuted at the Paris International Motor Show where the Prancing Horse also took the wraps off the Ferrari 488 Pista Spider, which had received its world premiere at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance.

It is an explosively innovative car whose refined, timeless beauty meant it became an instant contemporary design icon on its launch.

The Ferrari V12 spider story brims with legendary models, starting with the 166 MM from 1948 and running all the way up to the aforementioned 365 GTS4, also known as the “Daytona Spider”. The 812 GTS set a new benchmark in terms of both performance and exclusivity. Its majestic 800 cv Ferrari V12 engine makes it the most powerful spider on the market. It is also the most usable, thanks to its unique retractable hard top, which frees up extra luggage room. Two new gems were also added to the 8-cylinder range: the F8 Tributo and the F8 Spider. As its name suggests, the Tributo is the pinnacle of Ferrari achievement in this category as well as paying homage to the most powerful V8 ever built by Ferrari. The two mid-rear-engined two-seater F8s have very different characters crafted around the same 720 cv engine.

This is the first 6-cylinder ever used in a road car sporting the Prancing Horse badge: its massive 830 cv combined output delivers both unparalleled performance and exhilaratingly innovative soundtrack unique of its kind."},{"type":"focusImage","images":{"landscapeBig":"629e0a15da1ea90d28af3ce8-2021-ferrari-history-focus-3","portraitMedium":"629e0a15da1ea90d28af3ce8-2021-ferrari-history-focus-3"}},{"type":"focusText","title":"","description":"There were revolutions large and small on the communications and brand front too. After the launch of its new Corporate Identity, Ferrari made a stylish debut in the fashion world with its first ever fashion collection designed by creative director Rocco Iannone. The catwalk show took place between the productions lines where the Prancing Horse models are built. The collection is right at home in its natural habitat: the new Ferrari Stores which were completely redesigned as part of a project that also involved the successful renovation of the historic Ristorante “Cavallino”, now in the talented hands of chef  Massimo Bottura. Big names, just like Flavio Manzoni head of the design team that crafted the timeless lines of the latest addition to the Icona special series, the Daytona SP3,  inspired by one of the iconic cars in Ferrari history, the 330 P4. A masterpiece unveiled at the Finali Mondiali Ferrari at Mugello in November, providing yet another opportunity to celebrate the Prancing Horse’s success story on and off the track."},{"type":"focusCarousel","folderId":"337e5d4a-ffd4-4fbf-9179-4ff0da24f490"},{"type":"focusGrid","title":"2021 Masterpieces","description":"","focusGrid":true}],"models":["sf21","812-competizione","812-competizione-a","296-gtb","daytona-sp3"]},"slug":"2021","status":"published","publishedAt":"2022-06-06T14:22:24.615Z","id":"65c5f3e49cbe570022fb39cf","original":"629e052cda1ea90d28af3ce6","createdBy":"5da7091bf71b100ac0f01ab9","updatedBy":null,"createdAt":"2024-02-09T09:44:04.796Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-09T09:44:05.032Z","expireAt":null,"revision":11,"active":true}],"videoCover":{"landscape":"9d22d2db-a124-4e8c-a826-f18f91005db1","portrait":"9d22d2db-a124-4e8c-a826-f18f91005db1"},"introText":{"title":"The ORIGINS of the LEGEND","tip":"select_a_decade","text1":"Discover the moments that immortalised the legend of Ferrari, a race made of passion, craftsmanship and innovation","text2":"Since 1947, we have been building cars destined to win on the track and on the road, in Maranello.
